XID,How Long do you stay here,Project name,Review
R395606,1 Year,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,"Seems like Navin‚Äôs is a new builder with lots of trials and errors, no proper lift service after handover also , all 21 floors floods when it rains, not given standard car parking size, water treatment not done properly, we can see dirty water in bathroom as well as in kitchen. Ferocious street dogs roaming inside the building near my door, this under construction building serves you paint art on your cars left inside the building by sprinkling the paint art and cement dust all over your car. They will surprise us everyday with new headache rules which disturbs our daily life, Welcome to stressful world by spending your hard earned money."
R395606,1 Year,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,Honest review price to amenities review will give it a 3.5 on 5 or in more accurate terms a 6.8 on 10. Most features are good but suffer a little in some form or the other. Parking to mail box to entry road to location are mediocre at best. Yes but away from all the pollution and noise. A beautiful place to be.¬†
R395606,1 Year,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,It's absolutely quality construction. Good experience from beginning to till now the transaction.
R395606,1 Year,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,It was an excellent experience with Navins. I got a good feedback from my cousin brothers on this appartment and hence I am booking one more for my self.It is a value for money property. I am happy with the decision made for this purchase.Today I am a happy flat owner. My overall experience with Navins is really Excellent!!!! ....I will recommend anyone who wish to purchase a property with Navins.!!!
R395606,1 Year,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,"Navins Pinewood Tower in Medavakkam Excellent construction and amazing infrastructure. Club house, swimming pool, gym, kids play zone, theatre and other amenities superb. I am very happy. I‚Äôm very much emotionally and sentimentally attached. Especially Priya from CRM, she did great support and guidance. Sales person and Marketing Manager they did best for us. I had great experience and loving it. I‚Äôm very much eager to start our life in Navins."
R395606,1 Year,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,It was really a nice experience booking a flat at Navin's. Well received at site and provided excellent service. Explained all the key features while signing the agreement and overall much satisfied with the service. Thanks Navin's for helping me to purchase dream house!
R395606,1 Year,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,"We have purchased flat at Navins star wood Medavakkam. We purchased flat at Navins after hearing the quality work they provide. We are happy with quality but we foresee multiple issues which are not being addressed. We got the house handed over a month back. Below are the issues we are facing. When we raised the concerns to the CRM team, they were not ready to acknowledge and address customer issues. We had to follow the CRM team continuously to get any response, and obviously all their responses were NO.
1) Washroom had water getting stagnant. When enquired they are bringing the concept of dry area and wet area inside the washroom. But the water is getting stagnant when we step inside the washroom, there are high chances for elders to slip. They asked us to sweep / mop washroom whenever we used, to avoid water stagnant. Also we were informed this is constructed in Singapore model ( dry/ wet) area, what ever it is water getting stagnant in washroom is not acceptable. The only final answer we have received is nothing cannot be done, this is how all flats are constructed and it cannot be corrected. This is highly disappointing.
2) Car parking is not alloted in the same size for everyone. We booked the flat at 2019 Jan, where the house was under construction and we were not able to see the size of parking. Later during handover we were given a smaller one. Also before handing over we were told by CRM team that they will work on changing the car parking but finally after final handover now they are telling they will not change."
R395606,1 Year,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,"Plenty of open space and lot of security in and around this place, but no one cares where some one is going and coming. I went as guest to one of the flats in that place, I expected to be a tightened security and someone had to acknowledge if I have to be in that premise, but to my surprise, I could easily reach their doorsteps, without and security check. This place has a lot of social activity amenities, which will take half a day to tour by itself. Parking of each block are well managed."
R395606,1 Year,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,"If i want to buy a home then Navins is the only word arise in my mind for my dream home. Navins means love, trust, happiness, peaceful and secured stay. Navins Projects are not planned for business however built with more sentiments and utmost care towards our dream home. This brand name stood strong in the market for 30years with lot of hard work and sacrifices from Mr. Kumar's family and their team. Am really proud to be part of Navins family."
R395606,1 Year,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,"Easy to deal with Navin's, no compromise on Quality

Navin's did fantastic job, it was quick, two way communication, understanding customer needs, efficient and very professional. Primary reason for us to choose Navin's is Quality and Customer service, this was evident from day one of our interactions. I was given with every detail that I asked for, Sales and CRM team is taking effort to get that WoW factor. I came across very few builders in Chennai who care for their customer's and Navin's is one among them.

Special mention to Manoj from Sales, Ganesh and Priya from CRM. You guys are doing fantastic job."
R395606,1 Year,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,Our experience with Navin's from the beginning until handing over was smooth and comfortable. The CRM team is always available for any queries. We visited the site a lot of times before handover and the maintenance and the service teams patiently cleared our doubts and provided complete support.
R395606,1 Year,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,"1. Water stagnate Problem in all three bath rooms. It's really frustrating and also cleaning is very difficult. Before hand over and during inspection time no one informed about this.

Navins Feedback: wet and dry area separation in bathroom. but its not going to work for Indian culture.

2. Car Parking Issue:

Basement car parking is not yet ready for use, also car parking OUT construction will be completed based on the Phase 3 project. So basement parking IN and OUT we have to use IN line. No one told me about this. Its really tough to use basement car parking.

3. Club House

We paid 1.5 L for life time free admission fee we paid and use the free areas(baby playing areas, Gym, Swimming Pool and etc) without any additional cost as per the agreement. After handover the topic is different they are discussing about the package and for every year you have to pay 10K for maintenance. We paid 1.5 L for and we have 400 flats. 600L. But still they are collecting money from us.

4. Children Playing Area

Children's playing area in common for Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3. Its a small playing area its not possible to accommodate to all phases."
R395606,1 Year,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,"I am owner from Navin's Starwood . Very high maintenance cost, more than 6 K per month. The children don't have much place to play. Builders are asking the kids to play in parking lot :(. The amenities are not good enough for the crowd. Very arrogant management team who does not listen to the existing owners and does not want to deliver what was promised..."
R395606,1 Year,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,We are really happy to be a part of the Navins family. Amazing project and quality. Easy to access for chennai. Really impressed with Club house and Amenities. Thanks to customer support team.
R395606,1 Year,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,"After making a huge investment, I cannot park my Baleno car. Hope Navin drew the car border lines considering Nano car in mind üòÄüòÄ. Sometimes I used to take 5 mins to take my car outside of my car park without scratches and one good thing I cannot upgrade to any SUV(Indirect savings) üòû. Another thing I am paying rent of 6500K to 7500K including club house even after owning the property üòùüòùüòù. Don‚Äôt get carried away by model house and club house , those are attention grabbers and they mislead you hiding bad aspects like high maintenance, poor car park spacing.. just my advice"
R395606,1 Year,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,"Believe me they are extremely good salesman because the best salesman gives false promises and a lot of their commitments are without proofs until you sign the dotted lines and then there is hell because it's a point of no return. One really need to read between lines and unfortunately we don't do it and end up with a place like this.

Personally I got super excited about the ""World class clubhouse"" which was the only reason I bought the house only to realize that they would charge an yearly membership of 10000+ gst for a silver package over and about the amount of 1.5 Lacs I already paid for clubhouse during purchase, in fact over an above-mentioned heavy maintenance fee that is already collected.

To make matter worse, they easily twisted words but using terms like ""usage charges"" and now they have given a 1 year of ""complementary"" membership and I would have to pay after first year.

Long story short, they need to care of their existing customers like us and I think in order to grow in their business they need to learn on how to get obsessed with customers - a leadership principles that made Amazon a 2Tillion $ company. Their mission statement of keeping customer in the middle of all their business endeavors is still on paper yet to turn to reality for many of us.

Don't fall prey to their marketing gimmicks. Do your due diligence and approach the existing owners to know more about our problems before you sign."
R395606,2 Years,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,"Visited navins by trusting its brand..
But after seeing the cost sheet iam totally frustrated..
Buyers ignorance makes the builders to loot their hard earned money..
1.Very low UDS just 250 for 1234 sqt.
2.You charge for super built up area is that allowed in RERA.
3.car parking stilt should not be charged ..
They are pricing very high than the market rate..
Not worth..."
R395606,2 Years,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,"The building was constructed using Mivan technology which is seismic resistant and durable.
Pricing is affordable and near to OMR IT park.
Carpet area is very high compared to other builders. Navin's is one of the reputed builder in India."
R395606,2 Years,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,"Navins team ..4years back I paid 1.5lakhs for clubhouse and waited eagerly and patiently for it.. .but the reality is the clubhouse facitilty is not upto the mark for more than 1000 families...you are not even letting me to step inside until I again pay for using it.. Already I am paying high charge as maintenance which was supposed to include the clubhouse And you are asking to pay again ..i do not see any value in paying additionally.. Please return the 1.5lakh back since I don't want to use it

Update:
Navins Team ..When I state the actual fact how do you say its social media sabotage???As a sole owner of my apartment in phase1 I have the right to review phase1. Wont you have accepted it if I had given you 5 stars??? How is this related to my husbands review for phase2??
I have waited for more than 4 years to get any of the amenity. I am not asking anything for free.Already I am paying high maintenance charges in exchange for substandard maintenance and I feel I dont need to pay more for the clubhouse and other amenities.So Please return back the amount you charged for clubhouse as I dont need it. You havent provided any solution to my problem."
R395606,2 Years,Maple Sky Residences at Navins Starwood,Visited the house. Could be better if grilled windows and fuƒ∫ly covered openable heavy grilled balconies are permitted to be installed in top floor houses considering children's safety. Otherwise good.

R354172,2 Years,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,"Total Fraud by Shapoorji. The Foul Smell from the Garbage Dumpyard is Unbearable!! * This place is nothing short of a nightmare. The garbage dump yard located right at the society‚Äôs entrance. The smell is absolutely horrible, and it‚Äôs impossible to ignore. * Every day, dozens of trucks bring garbage from Maan and Hinjawadi and dump it here. They‚Äôve tried to hide it by putting up barricades, but the odor can‚Äôt be hidden. * The so-called riverfront view they advertise is actually a big sham. It is impossible to take a walk in the society and it's always smell like a gutter. Imagine your 1.5 CR+ investment and you are living in a gutter. * The builder is not taking any action despite multiple complaints from residents and owners. What‚Äôs worse. This pathetic builder is even sending notices to the people who are exposing this scam. * To make matters worse, some of this garbage is being dumped into the nearby river, which is also the water source for the society. Can you imagine how polluted the water is?"
R354172,2 Years,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,"Flat Buters are buying drinking water at the gate from outside agency why don't know . Common facilities like Recreation Hall and other facilitues may take more than 7-10 months to complete it seems. At the time of booking, very attractive promises were made to me like i will get Rental for my 2 BHK approx.ly 30,000 to 32,000 by Joyvilley concerned dep't. But after getting possession ladt week , found that Rent of Rs. 23,000 to 25,000 is not possible to get even after providing by me -buyer (not by Builder ) kitchen Trollies, Fans etc. In flat my flat. Furget about getting Rental equal to E.M.I. Installment Amount . Feels Cheated !!!!!!!!!!"

R354172,2 Years,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,"We are deeply disappointed that the local authorities are establishing a dumping ground next to our society towers, and the builder is not taking any action. This poses serious health risks, environmental damage, and decreases property values. I urge the builder to intervene and find a better solution."

This reflects poor management and a serious gap in training. Extremely disappointing experience."""

R354172,2 Years,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,It's shame that I need to reduce 5 Star rating to lowest rating possible just cause of recently made garbage dumpyard near by society. It's becoming very smelly everyday and difficult to live. 'Joy' in Joyville is getting replaced by 'Garbage' resulting Garbage ville and SP administration is least bothered about it. The ultra luxurious homes with all premium amenities are being downgraded just because SP is totally ignorant about this dumpyard and it's hazardous impact on Joyville residents. What an ultra luxurious shame..‚òπÔ∏è

1.It comes under gram panchayat, so lots of problem of Electricity and water.

2.Flat privacy is highly compromised by odd even terrace despite paying 97.3 Lakhs for 2bhk.

3.Go and ask any joyville resident they are not happy with there investment, no single owner is able to sell there house as no one wants to buy at this site.

4.Maintenance is high as water tanker comes frequently.
5.Project was is RED ZONE also due to extreme close to river.

6.No roads , no public transport connectivity, no shops near by.

7. No one knows the future but currently its for sure not a good investment."

R354172,2 Years,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,Those who like good amenities in society they should definitely go for this. Also those who want very less problems after getting flat and good service while leaving in society then this is good option. Also this builder handover flats before timeline. If we talk about other problems then forget about it it will be there everywhere. So I will suggest go for this.... 5* from my side for everything. Just small request to builder and management be as it as you are always. Thanks.....!!
R354172,2 Years,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,"Our journey of homeownership via shapoorji was superb throughout. We were always helped along the way by their CRM team, and eventually we got exactly what we expected when receiving possession via the Shapoorji team."
R354172,2 Years,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,"I am considering this project in Pune, very beautifully built!"
R354172,2 Years,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,"This new project is coming up in a very convenient location that is close to all the major hotspots and the daily needs of the residents. It is by a very well-known builder, Shapoorji Pallonji Real Estate, whose projects never disappoint."
R354172,2 Years,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,"The project seems designed with the modern resident in mind, offering comfort and convenience. It‚Äôs definitely one of the top projects I‚Äôm looking at"
R354172,2 Years,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,"I am currently residing in this area. Listing the issues here - 1) ""Approach road to this society"" from Hinjewadi-Maan road (near HP petrol pump) is very bad. No Street light on this road, so unsafe for travel after 6pm specially for ladies and childrens.. 2) Frequent power cuts - very unreliable power supply. 3) Water supply issue."
R354172,1 Year,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,Shapoorji Group is a brand that we can trust. Their projects are always top-notch and attractive. Joyville Sensorium by them is another amazing project with luxurious amenities. It offers great interiors and green surroundings that make it stand out from other projects in the locality.
R354172,1 Year,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,Wanted to book but reviews changed my mind .I can't risk overpriced flat for life time problem. Builder must clear all light and water problems else any project in wagholi is better than this sp project.
R354172,1 Year,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,We had a very good possession experience at Sensorium the staff was very polite and answered all our questions. It's more then value for money....keep up the good work.
R354172,1 Year,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,"Don't go with the builder name, it's very inside projects and the buil quality is not good, there are lots of issues in the plot 1 joyville. They are. Just selling on the builder name nothing else, there is no single shop beside the project, no public transport. Even there is power cut issue even the water is came by tankers due to such bad water lots of health issues as well as everyone in the society having hair fall problem. Very bad experience i have ever had and the sales team also not good, don't buy here."
R354172,1 Year,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,"in Joyville No water source other than river & tankers. In summer it will be hard to get water unless strong source from MIDC or Borewells are dug. Maan cant offer much water. Power shortage & frequent outage is another issue. this also needs to be attended by builder. Bad approch road n less no of street lights in rainy season also needs to be addressed Builder will have to use influence to get water from MIDC or Borewells. otherwise place will be hell in summer due to no water supply n many towers coming up. Please get other reliable source of water in writing in agreement. Concrete approch road from main road needs to be constructed by builders. For power, state govt needs to enhance capacity to provide uninterupted power."
R354172,1 Year,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,Beauty at its finest. Would highly encourage y‚Äôall to invest in a place that offers you best of all worlds - from service to atmosphere. You wont regret it.
R354172,1 Year,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,"Not even worth giving 1 star. Whoever is buying Sansorium, you are being fooled. You are buying pathetic property at a premium rate. Monthly maintenance is equal to rent of 1 RK ie 5k. I am an owner at joyville Hinjewadi which is situated just beside this so called another best project - Sansorium. Facilities to name few: - Very poor and savage management by SP - Power cuts more than 12 hrs - yellow and dirty drinking water - even no water for more than 15 hrs. - pathetic security To be noted that all other societies in the same location have better living conditions. SP has given a lame excuse of no permission for borewell though a nearby society has borewell. This is all happening currently and it has been only 1 yr since possession. Don't get fooled by good reviews. They are all brochure based."
R354172,1 Year,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,"Be very careful while buying it. There's loads of power cut off, water is still provided by tankers. Such a hard water which will harm your health. Even for basic necessities you have to go almost 3 kms. Poor infra and worst maintenance team. I mean they don't allow delivery boy inside the main premises"
R354172,1 Year,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,"No positive reponse from Builder. Only making false promises. Be very careful while buying it. There's loads of power cut off, water is still provided by tankers. Such a hard water which will harm your health."
R354172,1 Year,Shapoorji Joyville Sensorium,"SP Joyville sensorium is a good future for future perspective for family perspective, sales representatives Jyotsana & Manish assisted in a beautiful and friendly manner and cleared all my queries. I booked last tower Helius and positive for future. One must buy here if you like peace and nature with all luxury amenities. Even MIS international school is opening in a walking distance. CRM Ruchira is helpful and always ready to assist me in any query."
R330371,1 Year,Coco County,"COCO county is from the County group which has delivered some good projects in Noida. This project is quite conpact, kitchen is smaller then expected, club and swimming pool is maintained well"
R330371,1 Year,Coco County,"An ambitious project from the well known builder ABA Corp. From the developer's of Cleo County, Cherry County, Orange County. spread in 4.5 acre. All the flats are of 1152 sq ft, 3 bhk. Although rooms are little bit small but it's okay. Build quality is very good. Total there are only three towers, which is good. The club is very beautiful.

I am editing my review after possession. Wasn't expected from County group for this third class project. Below are the observation:-

1. The hardware used in flat are not up to the mark. Compromised with the quality.

2. The behaviour of maintenance team is arrogant.

3. It seems you are a tenant in your home.

4. You are not allowed to do any changes in your flat. Like balcony covering, show rack outside etc.

5. Even the design of the flat is like, if you're not covering your balcony, anyone can jump and enter in your flat from corridor. Easily accessible. Security threat.

6. If you want to book club banquet hall then There are specified vendor, you are bound to go with them. Monopoly. You can not choose the vendor as per your choice."
R330371,1 Year,Coco County,The quality of construction is great of this project. Location is great because of close proximity to Knowledge Park 5. Lots of amazing developments coming in sector-10 and 12. One of the best project in this area to invest.
R330371,1 Year,Coco County,"Pros:
*good airy ventilation structure
*12 flat on each floor, 6 lift, each tower portion equally divided
*beautiful club and swimming pool
* 3 side open, hence no nearby building
* Easy maintenance and Mivan based building structure

Cons:
*compact sized 3bhk
* no public transportation nearby, only private cab, private cars, auto
*10 to 15 min drive away from big shopping malls
* restaurants 10 to 15 min drive away, but food delivery options available"
R330371,1 Year,Coco County,"Great Project. Quality of Construction is Very Good.

Good size of 3BHK and very practical for a family."
R330371,1 Year,Coco County,"In block B No sun i winter and partial sun in summer.... and full electricity problem.

During chaat they play music on full volume since early in morning don't know if they wanna worship or harras other residents...no order in society by few in considerate residents."
R330371,1 Year,Coco County,"I have been staying in coco county since december 2023.
My experience in terms of maintenance and other services is good.
CLUB is highly maintained with gym and swimming pool.
Indoor play area is properly maintained.

Small commercial area with all shops like kirana shop,dairy shop,pharmacy,on call doctor,gift shop,restaurant,aata chakki are there and they get 99% of the routine things done.
2 good quality Unisex saloon are there.

Park,parking and outside area is neatly maintained.

There was some issue of electricity in initial 2-3 months.
Because of some technical glitch.

But it has been solved and also there is a back up and me personally have not faced any issue.

Blinkit and zomato works.
Nearby doctors and other requirements including hospital is there.

ONLY NEGATIVE IS-
Compact size 3 bhk....
But if you have a small family 3-4 person
Can easily manage.

Construction quality- GOODüëç

LIKE ANY OTHER PLACE....SMALL ISSUE HAPPEN EVERYWHERE.

MY EXPERIENCE with county group.
In terms of all White payment.... Registry process was smooth.

I haven't paid a single penny in cash.

So DECENT EXPERIENCE."

Only issue with The Location üòï - It's good but in totally Side üôÇüôÇ/ Not safety during nights especially for girls and all if working or self travel"
R330371,1 Year,Coco County,"Highly unprofessional team. no one cares about investors queries specially after all dues in account, specially their finance and CS team. Invest only if you have ample time to visit the site for small inquiries.Such a painful experience of my investment"
R330371,1 Year,Coco County,"Builders and brokers are creating hype in Noida. Government should check these things. They are playing with middle class money. They put out of stock and brokers sell on high resale prices. In pre launch suppose 6k sq feet and every 3 months they revised the prices, in construction phase 10k,15k then resale. Trapping the peoples. Don‚Äôt trust Noida builders.In Noida extension, metro didn‚Äôt even started and they increased price like anything.adding luxury and ultra Luxury fancy words to make innocent people‚Äôs fool."
R330371,1 Year,Coco County,"As usual, quality product delivered from county group. All facilities like maintenance, tower receptions etc are better than any other same tier society.
Overall a good investment for future as the area is already planned to be developed soon."
R330371,1 Year,Coco County,"Builder is reputed but society have 3bhk room size 10x10, not good but still good for budget. County group is best for its construction quality. And design of society some more famous project is Orange county, County107, Cherry county, and some more projects in noida, noida extenstion and some project in ghaziabad indirapuram."
R330371,1 Year,Coco County,"So much Fraud going here. Asking appx 40-50% in cash. Be safe and don't fall in the trap.
Builders and brokers are creating FOMO in this sector. Beware..!!"
R330371,1 Year,Coco County,Construction quality is good but layout very bad and maintenance not good as per County group compared to other projects. Dheele log bitha rakhe hain maintenence main Saare.
R330371,1 Year,Coco County,Extreme compact flats with 10*10 sq ft layout is not so good for family. Rates are too high acc to locality. no population nearby no shops even roads are also not developed.
R330371,1 Year,Coco County,Club is maintained by County group that is only good thing here. Maintenance is not able to take appropriate decision and always influenced by some residents which is going to deteriorate the County group reputation.
R330371,1 Year,Coco County,"Extremely compact apartment Located in Sector 10(Affordable housing sector) This was supposed to be the part of Affordable housing scheme but 99% apartments were sold to Investors and these investors are asking upto 88lac for the apartment which has carpet area of 639sq feet only.

What's the point of launching as an affordable house if these builders are going to sell the entire society to investors instead of common people. This isn't the only property in this sector, it's the case of all the properties in sector 10, arihant, ATS all are mostly on resale by investors who are asking over 80lac for these compact apartments."
R330371,1 Year,Coco County,"Most Unprofessional team..CRM team thinks they are owner of group or like God. They are so rude and shout like anything.
Ayushi is the person i was talking too. Never listens and understand customer grievances. Even after making a handsome amount of payments no confirmation via mail or call from team. you call them and they shout like anything. Neha doesn't even have the courtesy to pick up the phone/call back/message for even trying her number for more than a month. Need some different person in place of ayushi. HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL TEAM"
R330371,>3 Years,Coco County,"Negatives
1. Loading is very high out of 1152 sq ft only 644 sq ft carpet area.
2. Sector 10 is not developed yet not even a single kirana shop in the whole sector forget about other shops.
3. Road in front of the project becomes a swimming pool during rains.
4. Half of the flats will not receive any sunlight.
5. Small apartment with small kitchen and bathrooms.
6. Almost zero green area , no Central park.
7. Farmland behind the project, nobody knows what will come behind it.
8. Greedy builder , stopped transfer of newly delivered flats.
9. High rate , in the same rate you can get apartment in heart of Noida extension.

Positives
1. Mivan based construction
2. Construction seems solid.
3. Name of builder"
R330371,>3 Years,Coco County,It will be long risky bet if anyone buys home in here. The amenities and facilities are from reach.
R330371,3years,Coco County,Well managed Society. There is a green belt right in front of the Society. Also they don't allow guest vehicles inside.
R330371,2 Years,Coco County,I have booked there too. I am excited about the same. I did my home work and also asked people who are living in cherry county and cleo county. As of now the project looks like a little further away from noida extension buzz but I‚Äôm sure that also makes it a good investment for future.
R330371,2 Years,Coco County,"Team are not at all professional.. They are extremely rude and never listen to their clients.
I want to escalate the behavior of Nikita as she's the one who always talk unprofessionally and very rude to everyone. Never come back with the solution, never guide their clients and when asked she shouts like anything. Please take action regarding her behavior."

R330371,1 Year,Coco County,Newly constructed small society with all the facilities. Only drawback as per me small kids play areas.
R330371,1 Year,Coco County,One of the best locations to buy a house if you looking for peace of mind..few things which could be an issue is ..no public transport..
R330371,1 Year,Coco County,Carpet area is too small compared to premium price. Room size are so small that you cannot place double bed else there will not be space in the rooms. All in all useless to invest....

R303861,1 Year,Piramal Mahalaxmi,"Company replied today to my review posted a week ago, that my concern has been attended is again a big lie, no resolution has been offered by Piramal. Booked an apartment in Mahalaxmi with Piramal. At booking, they promised flooring selection options‚Äîmarble samples were even displayed. Now they‚Äôre backing out, asking for written proof. Disappointing to see a brand like Piramal go back on its word."
R303861,1 Year,Piramal Mahalaxmi,"Piramal Mahalaxmi -a magnificent project to live in the south Mumbai offering the cinematic views of the Mahalaxmi racecourse and the Arabian sea. The Central tower positioned at its best in order to the excellent offering of Piramal Mahalaxmi as it gives eventual privacy by having 4 residences at each floor with a scenic view of south Mumbai. This flourishing & progressive project, with its hustle & bustle of the streets, rich traditional culture elucidates the charismatic fusion of past to present. Piramal Mahalaxmi is the Largest Residential Project in South Mumbai, with over Development of 2 million sq ft, it will have high rise towers which will have Uninterrupted Views of 225 Acres big Mahalaxmi Race Course & Arabian Sea. Piramal Mahalaxmi project is well connected to the rest of the town, the location is close to Mahalaxmi Station, Roads, and upcoming Metro and Monorail Projects."
R303861,1 Year,Piramal Mahalaxmi,"After Sales Service is a big miss and no one will attend and every one will try to avoid calls. There is no transparency in their pricing. Merciless management on any request put up after registration of the flat and after clearing the payment. Your answer is not correct. Pls do not justify. Your team has not picked up nor responded. Only after sending mail to Mr Ajay Piramal, got a call and justified the charges. Let the world know how come you can level interest for 3 days wherein 98% of the total cost has been paid?? Which builder will cheat and level like this in India or around the world?? Nitish Rodrigues was my CRM. He used to respond and answer only for payment. He always avoid my calls and meeting. Nowadays he blocked my no after getting 98% of the payment 2 yrs before the possession. Pathetic organisation."

R303861,1 Year,Piramal Mahalaxmi,"Upto now, the entire experience has been great. Going forward, i believe the location will be amazing as this project straddles south mumbai with the suburbs. With the upcoming developement on the Mahalaxmi racecourse and the breath taking sea view, i believe i have made a good investment banked by the Piramal reputation and backed by an excellent support team with special mention for my rm Nitish Rodriquez who even answers my queries on holidays as i am based abroad. Thank you Nitish for bearing up to me."
R303861,1 Year,Piramal Mahalaxmi,"Very dissapointing . They took 5 lakh token to book with promise that if the deal is cancelled then they would refund the money in 30 days. Appalling to see that such a big company cannot eveb return such an amount on time even after 3 months as that deal didnt go through, as if they cannot pay back 5 lakhs what they will deliver the product on time.I would advice to avoid dealing with them and being very cautious when it comes to money. The dont even respond to phone calls. Hopefully I get back my deposit"
R303861,1 Year,Piramal Mahalaxmi,Piramal mahalakshmi is very best project last sunday i went there for a meeting. Heritage dhobi ghat in front and beautiful race course view from middle floor.

The organisation has conducted business in a very professional manner and that has made me invest confidently.I have not seen the work in progress so unable to comment on quality and value. Keep it up and look forward to the early completion of the building.
R303861,1 Year,Piramal Mahalaxmi,Nice project and expect some great views of the race course once it is completed. Challenge is the narrow roads around the building and the nearby fish market. Seems this will change as per the new development plan for the area. But considering the slow pace of things in India for infrastructure updates one can‚Äôt really be sure

R303861,1 Year,Piramal Mahalaxmi,"Please please dont ever think of buying a property with Piramal. Very unprofessional and non-responsive. I went to see their Mahalaxmi property on Dec 30, 2021. They asked me to pay some token if I wanted the exact pricing of any one flat and they said it is FULLY refundable in 30 working days. I paid them Rs. 3,00,000/- since I wanted to figure out the exact pricing and I was almost keen to go ahead. Then After 10 days, on Jan 10, 2022 I already informed them that I did not want to go ahead due to a family emergency. It is now 1 month and more than 30 working days since I have been following up with them to return the token amount. Very slow, very unresponsive and unprofessional. Infact they should be paying me interest on the same. Pls dont ever deal with the group. So what if its Piramal or Ambani - all big robbers"

R303861,1 Year,Piramal Mahalaxmi,Superb quality construction work
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,It's very poor service management. Kindly hire traind staffs. My bags was stone. The secretary guard not aware of this.
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,Well planned besides being open with buildings being well distanced.
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,The builder does not allow customers to visit their own homes while it is being built till they collect the last rupee. Different customer representatives all for money without proper documentation and in their own account. The project was significantly delayed even though it was Rera registered. Customers could not opt out without losing money. I strongly suggest starting away from this builder.
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,Went there for a event Amazing property One of the premium locality
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,"The scenary was amazing and was worth for the entry fee Taken by the management cleanliness was also there but there wasn't any food court or souvenir shops only water stall was there and it wasn't also chilled many shops were under construction it is very far from Thane Rly Stn and bus connectivity is also not frequent and after 7pm while returning if the bus comes then also crowd is too much many people hang on the edge of doors it is also not possible to go in that If you have a car and planning for a photoshoot it is the best but by public transport it is little bit hard to reach there or you can also book ola, uber or local taxi or auto"
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,"Many beautiful playgrounds for kids, a beautiful pond. Weekends are very full, weekdays after 4pm is the best time to visit"
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,if there a rating below 1 would have given that useless builders there customers service is at worst level always say will call you back in 5 min and that never happens no clarity avoid there projects
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,The project plan is amazing grand but the service is worst .. They are terrible .. no fixed CRMs they keep changing . They wil show big dreams but will shatter . We booked a flat and are really stuck .. they connect to you when they need to raise demand . Their new system of hi is absolutely waster they close the case without giving a call back . Delayed possessions . They told us first that people will have access to the grand Central Park and sold the property the previous CRM said it‚Äôs not the case . We need to pay for it .evrytime you speak they possession date changes

R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,Had a wonderful experience at Kalptaru Immensa today. Thanks for the warm welcome. A place with lot of open spaces and lush greenery. Thanks to every one for making this moment very special for us.
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,It was a wonderful experience all throughout. Would recommend!!
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,"An absolutely unprofessional post sales approach , The crm team responds to no requests . Absolutely unbothered by what customer wants, zero empathy towards customer and only works as 0er their wimps and fancies unappauled by any escalations at any level. They will flip their words in 5 minutes be careful. The only 1 star is for the sales guy aditya who is tried to provide all help he could in his ability but a disastrous post sales experience , they have treated house buying experience worse than buying from street side shops"
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,"Experience so far has been great... Karan and Shivani were to the point, transparent and gave us a lot of comfort. Hoping for an equally smooth experience leading up to posession"
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,Good town planning. Booked my apartment in Eternia. Process was smooth and well organised. Karan Sharma is an excellent executive who understands your requirement and suggests the best project and plan. Eager to see how the work develops and completes in the given time. Kalpataru Parkcity - a dream home project
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,First visited Parkcity three years ago. Can see a huge difference between then and now. There is a lot of greenery and thoughtful planning. The Grand Central Park makes it lush green. Feels like a well-planned township with lots of space which is a rarity in Mumbai.
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,"Had gone to explore options in new project Eternia around 10 months back. Was attended by Ms Diksha who was very courteous, helpful and still continues to support. Same cannot be said of their CRM team though."
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,"Visited this place with my family, good project with great location really loved the design. met manager called Aniket Chilap thanking him with the knowledge and guidance he has provided us that has helped us to decide on location and project finalisation."
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,"Kalpataru Parkcity is an ideal choice for homebuyers looking for a blend of luxury and nature. The project offers spacious, well-designed apartments with top-notch amenities, including a clubhouse, swimming pool, gym, and children's play areas. Its vast green spaces and landscaped gardens create a serene environment, promoting a peaceful lifestyle. The location is well-connected, with proximity to schools, hospitals, shopping centers, and transport hubs, adding convenience to daily life. The project is also known for its strong security features, ensuring safety for residents. Kalpataru Parkcity promises a premium living experience with sustainable and modern infrastructure. I received excellent customer service and was impressed with the personalized attention throughout the process. The team was responsive, attentive, and made sure all my questions were answered promptly. What stood out most was their commitment to offering the best pricing options. They went out of their way to ensure I got the best deal, providing transparent and competitive pricing with no hidden costs. The entire experience felt smooth and stress-free, thanks to their professionalism and clear communication. Overall, it was a perfect blend of great customer service and unbeatable pricing, making me feel valued as a client."
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,Ayushi from sales team was very helpful in accommodating what I was looking for. Also to mention Faraan who helped me scout the property.
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,loyalty manager alisha was helpful with the pricing and gave extra discount . Also the manager explained very well and make sured the client is getting comfortable first.
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,Excellent project with greenary. Sales person is very cooperative and explained very well
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,"Don‚Äôt buy in parkcity. Zero security from Kalpataru. Main entrance is unmanned and nearby residents use internal roads for pet walks, pooping and all illegal activities. Better to buy a house in nearby property like Wadhwa ( which saves your money) and just cross the road for using kalpataru parkcity internal roads ( no restrictions of entry by outsiders) as amenities for walking, jogging, pet walks etc. Kalpataru is interested in selling the property at premium and not interested in increasing the security ( 7 tier security as pitched and advertised), restricting the entry of outsiders & not maintaining premium atmosphere"
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,0 rating is not possible that's why 1 star. KP has spent their full energy to develop grand Central park by delaying immensa project. Made the place accessible to other people and ruined resident's peace of mind without thinking about privacy and security of the entire project. All the best to Eternia and Primera buyers. It's going to take forever. Sit back and relax!!!
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,They are not delivering Imensa park city 5-6years delay from 2016 to till now and they have launch new building in KALPATRU PARK CITY if any one put your hard money to this like builders you will be frustrated you don't know what will happen with u And u will be trapped in their hand .government not take any action like thi
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,Great upcoming project in Kolshet Thane. Sunrise is fully occupied. The other projects appears reassuring and promising
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,"WORST EXPERIENCE! 1. The main entrance is also a common entrance for the newly developed Thane Central Park. 2. The internal roads for the township are also common roads for to the central park. 3. Experienced ZERO sense of security, as all the external crowd is freely moving in the township. 4. Just outside the Sales office , saw a 4-wheeler parked with the driver leisurely smoking with windows open. 5. And the WORST PART- we had unfortunately shared our contact number with the sales team and within a week we have started receiving 100s of calls from all builders' sales office for purchase of property. When we enquired from where did they receive our number, they bluntly replied that our number was LEAKED to them. PURE HARRASMENT. Do visit the site and experience the above. Please be careful and not share any contact with them."
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,"Don't go if you receive a call for buying property.. I had a very bad experience.. The person who called, told me that he is available their and will help to close the deal in the particular said amount and also sample flat is available After visiting some other person was telling the details having difference of 30 lack rupees and the sample flat was also not available When I asked for the person who called me they were giving me excuss that he is busy with some another team When I tried calling him he is not even receiving my calls,not even called after visit. Totally waste of time.."
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,Liked this place a lot ! A decent place to enjoy with family and friends. The only thing which is annoying that the park seems like much for kids ! Overall a great and beautiful experience
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,The great central park in thane. This is like global architect by kalptaru. This urban park spread over 20 Aceres land. 3500 trees are cultivated here. And it's named Namo central Park also.
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,"The corresponding infra hasn‚Äôt been that well developed.

1st phase has a nice getup and has come up in a good way.

A public park named Namo Central Park has come up as well.

Township is spread across 110 acres.

The 2nd phase is heavily delayed.

Kalpataru was struggling through finance issues.

Better to check out other projects before zeroing down on this one.

The complex is surrounded by other reputed developers"
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,A modern township themed around a central park. Calm by the day but gets pretty busy by evening as people from all over Thane City flock here to visit the garden.
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,"Far away from proposed metro station. Metro is future for Ghodbunder road, try to find property nearby metro 4 station. Even you have property at Guymukh (last stop of GB road) it would be prime property once Meteo 4 operational."
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,"Kalpataru Central Park in Thane, Maharashtra, is an exemplary residential complex that embodies luxury, convenience, and sustainability. From the moment you step into the premises, you're greeted by lush greenery and meticulously landscaped gardens, creating a serene oasis amidst the bustling city. The architecture is nothing short of impressive, with modern design elements seamlessly integrated to provide residents with spacious, well-lit interiors and breathtaking views of the surroundings. The amenities offered cater to every aspect of a comfortable lifestyle, whether it's the state-of-the-art fitness center, rejuvenating spa, or the inviting swimming pools."
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,Beware of this builder!! They will say their project is RERA registered and will take Covid extension given by RERA but when disputes arise they don‚Äôt follow RERA. Disputes are under arbitration act they claim just to delay the hearing process and harass their own buyers. There is no exit once you sign the first cheque even if the project gets delayed by 10 years. Promoter has a clear intention to cheat and pass their losses to the customer. Still you want to invest then god bless you!!
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,It's a very big park .much for small kids play area for them is too good.theme park is also nice.The review is only for central park.
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,Amazing park to spend time with family and friends. Weekends are too crowded. Outside eatables are not allowed. It is 6-7km away from Thane station.
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,"The reviews which you see 5 star are from slaes kalpataru itself. I noted some of the names from kalapataru sales. I recently booked a 4BHK with a hope that structure is ready and possession will early. Please do not fall in trap, and consider Rera possession date which Dec 25 plus 6 month grace period as per agreement. Also, what they commit at booking they never fullfill based on my last 3 months experience. The CRM team is just for name shake, they will put concern under grevience and also impose penalty for delay in payment due to greviece delay. Logically if something is under review, how can you impose penalty on customer without inforrming. They will call you 100 time before booking but pathetic customer service start after taking 10 percent."
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,"Good presentation. Noted however that the 'Great park' they mention so prominently is actually owned by TMC and will be maintained by a Kalapataru company. Park city residents will be charged for using the park. Noted Immensa has had an over 3 year delay, which fills me with no confidence for the current set they are selling (Eternia?). Maintainence is high at almost 10rs a sq ft. Its about a 100Rs by rick in the afternoon to get to Thane station - i.e. is quite far. I would not buy without checking the construction quality of an actual delivered building within the complex."
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,Please DO NOT purchase flats in Kalpataru Parkcity Kolshet road Thane West We booked a flat in Immensa in Dec 2019 (Already under construction since 2016) They said we will get the possession in 2021. Every year after visiting the site they are giving false commitments stating that we'll get possession next year. Also giving lame excuses that because of Covid 2019 they had to stop the construction.. The world had started building construction in covid19 and they were able to complete the project within 2 years and Kalpataru is still stuck with Covid19 excuses We are paying our EMIs for no reason Last year in Sept 2022 we again visited the under construction building (Immensa) They said we will get the possession in March 2023. Upon visiting the site on 5th Oct2023 we got to know that its still in the same state as we saw last year in Sept 2022 Infact much worse The main entrance road is deteriorating day by day Lots of potholes And shamelessly are asking for lakhs of rupees from us without giving us any absolute clarifications Very disappointed from renowned building Kalpataru
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,"Kalpataru Immensa at Kalpataru Parkcity, Kolshet Road Thane has been delayed for too long. Work has moved at snails pace. People who have booked flats in 2016, 2017 were assured that possession would be given in 2021. Its May 2023 now with no clarity or commitment on date of possession. People who put in their hard earned money are suffering & going thru a financial crisis as they are paying full EMI since the slab work is complete, while continuing to also pay rent. Kalpataru had a good name earlier but with this project they have really lost all the good will & made people wary of investing in their projects"
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,"I am sure Kalpataru Park City will be big landmark in future. Project USP is Grand Central Park. We visited Sunrise during our project tour, it's highly maintained which shows quality of the project. Entire staff is extremely professional. Saurabh is the person who helped me in understanding every small query I had, he explained entire project , we took around 3 to 4 hours and thanks to his patience. I visited with my family first time and end of the day we booked 2bhk."
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,The main door frame is hopeless. Is it wooden.? While you are charging you could have used better quality of wooden frame for doors
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,The place is beautiful but wasn't impressed with the sales team. The sales guy assigned to us was extremely non chalant and disengaged. Having preconceived notions about custumers is bad for anyone. We prebooked a spacious Lodha flat on the same day after much thought.
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,"Share if any official statement or give update here about much delayed, non completion of immensa parkcity project and slow progress of other underconstruction starlight expansia parkcity tower ."
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,Thane's largest park is been built around a one of a kind development spread around 100 acres in Kolshet road.
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,Really good property with a lot of open spaces and a host of amenities. The construction quality is amazing. One of my friends stay in this property and really appreciates the detailing done by Kalpataru group in this project.
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,All of there projects are delayed. Prefer not to buy any property from this builder. There are many good options to opt for. Please dont waste your money
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,Worst experience ever with Kalpataru builder. Booked flat in immensa at pre-launch in 2016. At that time promise was made to give possession on 2019 but still many of there customers are facing issues. No one at management willing to take responsibility of delay. Even false they change the agreement.
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,I dont know why kP is more interested of persuading employees to give 5 ratings instead of doing actual work on ground. Do the work and you will get fair ratings. Fake ratings eventually fail. We are suffering from your delay in project even long before covid times no work has happened on site.
R343401,1 Year,Kalpataru Parkcity,"They are good in making promises, but nowhere near fulfilling them Do not but under construction from them, they will just make slabs and then sit on funds with no view of possession All projects are massively delayed"
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,I was really interested in buying a 4bhk but dropped the plan seeing how unprofessional and rude the folks on the ground are. Heard similar feedback from so many folks including Channel Partners.
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"Keya around the life‚Ä¶ Booked a flat with the builder, full of hopes, only to see them transform into frustration and agony. The promised completion date of October 2024 was gradually pushed to December, then February, and even now it's a uncertain.. Despite not receiving my flat, the CRM team's behavior has seen a disappointing transformation‚Äîfrom bad to worse. Formal inquiries about the project‚Äôs status are often ignored, and responses, if given, come with a dismissive stance: ""Take the money and leave if you're not interested."" The CRM, who is supposed to guide customers through every step, has been an utter failure in this case. To make matters worse, the specially trained sales team seems to excel at amplifying frustration, pushing it to unimaginable levels. Both the CRM and sales teams lack professionalism, empathy, and a sense of accountability. They fail to recognize the time and money customers have invested in their homes"
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"I regret trusting Keya Homes with our dream of owning a home. Our experience with the Keya Around the Life project has been disappointing and frustrating. Despite promised handovers in Nov 2024 and then Jan 2025, we're still waiting. Communication is poor‚Äîemails and calls go unanswered. Site visits are restricted, and our recent visit revealed significant work still pending, yet balance payment demands started arriving. When we sought clarity, their sales team member, Praful, was shockingly rude, dismissing our concerns and asking us to leave. Such unprofessionalism, paired with unclear timelines, has caused immense frustration. Future buyers, beware‚Äîproceed with caution"
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"If you ever want to get treated badly & cheated - get threatened and intimidated after paying in such a huge sum of money, then only you should go for this apartment. Arrogance after taking all your money, if you want to experience- buy apartment and speak to Praful from sales. Stay away from this builder -"
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"Very very bad experience with this builder .If there was a rating in negative I would hv selected that .I hope the positive reviews mentioned here have genuinely checked ,.experienced the truth & rated here because I feel it is a fabricated review. We hv booked an apartment here which we think one of the worst decision ever to make .Rather than here we should hv gone to tier 1 builders . Booking here hv not helped us in any pricing discount rather we paid equivalent amt.But the after service is pathetic .Their CRM don't know to talk actually I should say they don't know the actual meaning of CRM what is their significance. The sales representative OMG I don't hv words to tell abt this great guy ....very sorry to say this gentleman don't know to talk ...when we are asking Genuine question sir is saying pay Money & go ....I mean look at the audacity of them ...it is like it is not Keya's responsibility to answer our concerns at all....the people there don't hv responsility to answer our calls or ny other mode of communication.There's only one say ..pay the money get the hand over ...where the status of the project is nowhere near to completion for us to stay ...when we are asking the status ... there reply is pay the money .... There is one arrogant guy in the sales team Praful, he doesn't even know how to talk to ladies. That's the way this whole organisation is built. We are stuck, I don't want anyone else to fall into the same trap"
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"One of the worst experience you can get from sales team or management. Zero customer service, you get threatened by staffs if you enquire about checking the flat even when OC was given."
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"Worst builder in the entire Bangalore. They act like dictators and never even pick the call and you can only send email and they take their sweet time to respond. Incase of an emergency you cannot even contact them and the reason they give is people are working and they have lots of email to see. Its a one way communication, you can only speak to them when they want. So in entire Bangalore, only Keya Home people are working. üòÑ Society is nice but their attitude will stop them from becoming a Tier1 builder. Such attitude you won‚Äôt even see in likes of Prestige, Godrej, Sobha etc. Please have these things in mind before booking an apartment with them. Akshita from CRM team never picks up the call and is not even aware of the process properly. Prafull from the Sales is rude and simply disconnects the call saying whatever you have to say send an email."
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"This place is our dream home and has evolved just the way we had imagined. Everything Around the Life is spectacular- be it the amenities provided, our flat or the place overall . The entire structure has been very well planned with a good amount of thought given to even the smallest detailing. Very good quality of materials and amenities provided . Overall absolutely fantastic!!! If you‚Äôre looking forward to invest in properties then Keya Homes is the right choice !!!!"
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"Project is good. Very neatly come up. Worth living. Small society with limited number of flats. Club house is very nicely built. BUT Builder is very high headed. No after sales service, only one way communication flows. If you have any confusion or need clarity, then you need to live with it. From builders end it is 'go to hell' response. Owners are pained by their approach. Owners have no clue whom to contact or connect for petty queries. Builder should have kept a team to address queries of 450 odd buyers. He only dictates his term and will keep changing his stand as no one can ask questions from him. Even after paying entire amount you will not be allowed to even take measurements. Overall Good society to live at. Flats are nice but builder approach is a big pain."
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"All the approval from RERA and BDA are received now. So can write honest review now. This is my first home buy and honestly was in double mind while booking, by seeing thier open ness in showing what not done and what approval are pending went ahead with booking, they didn't even cashed in my cheque untill BDA approval and cheque is void, that much honest they are in my case. Builders are very straight forward policy on price and commitment. Same is followed by sales executive kavitha. From day 1 they told me we will not do any price reduction. And while booking also same. I was very happy with the detail that received by me on construction details they have given me. Mr. Prafull also helped me with all the process and along with kavitha and sangeetha from CRM team, they are there till today for any query over whatsapp. Pricing is matter of persective, but they have very good floor plan and spacious 3 and 4 bhk flats. And construction quality and speed is good. Hoping to move in much before promised time."
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"I recently visited the site and was shown the location of an available ground floor flat (access to the unit itself was not permitted). From the window, I could see its approximate position. The adjacent Desai Apartments building appears very close, potentially impacting sunlight access to the balcony. When I raised this concern with the salesperson, their reaction was defensive and unprofessional. While I understand sales targets exist, this behavior was off-putting."
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,I wish i could rate them negative. Worst Management. We went to see the flat. They denied us showing actual flat. In addition the sales lady started misbehaving. I could possible think of post sales management.
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"There looks to be something fishy in this property. I have been interested in considering this property but they are not agreeing to show the property from inside despite even receiving the OC. Upon asking for the reason, they said they have been instructed to do so, by the management. I have seen some builders not giving the promised specification or even the carpet area shown in their plan, so watch out, these guys may have a similar goof up."
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,Looks overpriced....they are not allowing to see the flat before purchase....can't understand the logic...
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,Good and peaceful location. Best master plan and floor plan. Whitefield - hoskote main road 650 meters away. Many prestigious restaurants and schools nearby.
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,I wish had option to put lesser ratings. Poor CRM who will update at their convenience. Good at over committing and taking money out of peoples pocket. And ofcouse their answer to everything is cancel your booking and we will refund the entire amount. PLEASE DONT FALL IN THE TRAP AS WE DID. THERE AFE BETTER BUILDERS IN THE MARKET
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"The flat designs are nice, good location, all legally good to go. Bought an apartment at good price being one of the first buyers. Construction is moving at a good pace, hoping to get the place earlier than the RERA date. I am optimistic that the builder will fulfill commitments regarding amenities and deliver a residence of high quality."
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"Some communication and commitment issues, they wanted to handover 6 months earlier than RERA commitment but looks like it will touch the RERA timeline, but so far not so disappointed with apartment layout planning and location. Let's see."
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,The project looks amazing so far. Builder is delivering a quality product.
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,Spacious functional layout. Quality build and workmanship. Timelines completed within RERA. Suitably located between Kadugodi and Ceegehalli on Main Whitefield Hoskote road. Close to Markets and Schools. Vibrant community and promising developer.
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,Construction quality looks good and they seem to be well ahead of their RERA timeline of June 2025 for completion. Model flats looks quite spacious and I believe their usp is location which is close to Kadugodi Metro station on Whitefield-Hoskote road.
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"Really great project by a rather new real estate player, Keya Homes. The highlight of the project - * Location: Very close to Whitefield multi-modal hub (metro station, suburban railway station, eastern railway station, bus depot), ~3km, making it a prime location. With the SH35 (east airport corridor) just 650m from the project there are ample option of bus and taxi. Also the internal road to the project from highway is 50ft wide with proposal to widen in future. * Neighbourhood: Many Chaitanya Villa projects are surrounding the project along with other good builders. The area, although its upcoming, but already has Rolla hypermarket, good restaurants/bars, Kfc, MacD, Firstcry, flea market, movie theatre, mall etc within a range of 1km. Best part is that Prestige is coming up with Forum Mall just 1km away. However has some concerns related to flooding, but the builder has mentioned water will not enter the premises due to elevated basement. * School/Hospital: Many renowned schools are nearby the project. The Valistus International School and Chrysalis High School are just 300m away. Apart from that there are NPS whitefield(3km), Kidzee, Vibgyor, Deens are nearby. There are a few hospitals also like Miracle mother/child, RxDx, Axis etc. * Layout: The project is spanning 4.68acres with 468 units and more than 50+ amenities. The envisioned signature Verde clubhouse is really impressive with many facilities. Verified it from their previous project in TGT which looks delivered as promised. The shops inside the project will provide the residents easy access to daily needs. * Floor plan: With a 73% carpet ratio, the floor plan is better than many A-grade builders. The attraction for all flats are the bay-window, walk-in wardrobe and french/juliet windows. Instead of wasting space in bathrooms or small balconies, they have increased the room sizes. For example, the 3BHK has master bedroom of 16ft x 11ft, even excluding walk-in wardrobe. As per vastu also all the flats are east/west/north facing only, the master bedroom corner is south-west, almost every flat has a window in the north-east corner of the flat for divine air. * Quality: As per the latest updates, the builder is using best quality sanitary from Kohler, thermostats, electrical wirings, outside waterproof paints etc. They are also doing a third-party quality inspection by ‚ÄúPropCheck‚Äù and fix issues before final handover. * Timeline: The RERA date for the project completion in June 2025, but with the latest update , the project already has almost completed most of NOCs, and tentatively receive OC by this year end. Expecting handover by beginning of next year. The project being completed in 2.5yrs is quite impressive without quality compromise. Even Sobha, Prestige has 5yrs RERA completion date. * Pricing: The builder maintains a fixed price policy with no discounts, which is good in terms of dealing because its brings transparency among buyers. The rates have increased now but still lower than Prestige PPG in the vicinity. * Investment: Area has quite a lot of potential to gain traction in future. The PRR is planned within 1km from the project which, if started, will definitely see a big boom in commercial and infrastructure developments. The metro extension to Hoskote may also be along the SH35. The eastern corridor to airport can make the project nearer to northern bangalore also. There is a owners whatsapp group to join, if interested. As a customer/owner, we are anticipating great result and hopefully will be delivered what has been promised."
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"I was really happy with the way the flats have been aligned utilising the space to its maximum. Also, the location is quite good and hardly 500 metres from main road. Glad to be part of this upcoming society."
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,Great apartment layouts and no compromise in quality. Booked an apartment here.
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"Keya ATL project stood out in our evaluation with other options in Whitefield due to spacious layout with higher SBU to CA ratio, Modern amenities, bay window in master bedroom, juliet balcony in bedroom etc. Proximity to Whitefield, Metro, Hospitals, Schools, Malls, Markets at walkable distance etc."
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"I have purchased a 3 bhk in this society, i am really impressed with their floor plan and the way keya authorities are trying to deliver the project on and rather before time."
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"Very spacious and luxurious society coming up. Proximity to main markets, metro, hospitals, and schools makes it a beautiful haven."
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"One of the best projects in Whitefield area. Very spacious and vastu compliant flats at a good price point. Top quality construction, fittings and materials with best in class amenities."
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,If you are thinking of buying an apartment make sure you don‚Äôt go with Keya ever. They have the shittiest CRM team who will reach out to you only when they need money. And if you need any progress update you will literally have to bang your head on the wall because they will never reply. No point of contact. Imagine paying 1.20 cr+ and still feeling so clueless. Relationship starts with communication and these guys will let you down miserably
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"Update: We have a TG group for the owners - Keya around the life owners We just got a 4BHK flat at Keya-Around The Life, and we're really happy with our choice. The flat has a great design with big rooms that get lots of sunlight and fresh air. It's in a super convenient spot, only 2 KMs from Kadugodi Metro station. What's really cool about KEYA-ATL is how they stick to their promises about finishing construction on time. They said they'd complete one floor every week, and in just two months, they've already finished more than 8 floors - Tower A is completed till 22 floor! The price is a bit high although they're a new builder, but I like that they keep things simple with a fixed price. In October, they got all the necessary approval from BDA and RERA for all 23 floors. This is my first property in Bangalore, and I'm impressed with KEYA's after-sales customer service. Sangeetha and Kavita from the CRM and marketing teams have been quick to respond and help with any issues. Overall, I'm a happy customer! Hope to get the possession by next Diwali as promised by the team. If anyone needs more details or has any other query, please reach out to me on LinkedIn."
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"We have booked 4BHK flat in Keya-Around The Life. The reasons we chose KEYA - Around The Life (KEYA-ATL) are following: (1) Floor plans: Floor plan of 4BHK is very good with over 70% ratio of carpet to super build up area. The rooms are spacious with ample sunlight and ventilation. A 4BHK with equivalent or higher floor plan in Kadugodi/Hope farm/Whitefield area will easily cost north of 3Cr. (2) Location: With Kadugodi Metro station about 2.5 kms away, ITPL being 6km by road, good schools/hospitals/malls within 5-6 km radius, the location is very prime.. The apartment being located about 700m inside from Kadugodi main road, we get good connectivity without main road traffic hassles. (3) Possession timeline: Baring KEYA-ATL, Almost all of the under constructions properties, be it Villa or flat, we had seen in Bangalore East area, have possession timelines starting from 2026 onwards.. KEYA-ATL has RERA completion date of June 2025. After inquiring about their previously delivered two projects (Life By The Lake and The Green Terrace) and coming to know that they had been delivered well ahead of their RERA timeline, and also witnessing the construction progress of KEYA-ATL (all towers are constructed above 17 floors), we are hopeful to get possession in time.. (4) Transparency from builder side: When we visited the KEYA-ATL, they showed their honesty by saying they had applied TDR to modify the existing plan and the process for the same (BDA approval + RERA approval) was not completed. Like anyone else, we too were skeptical and were looking other properties. However, to mitigate this issue and still being in legal bounds, KEYA offered flat booking for which approvals were already available and later agreed to change the booking to higher floors once the BDA + RERA approval is achieved, at the same base cost which was offered at the time of booking. When we agreed to this way of booking, KEYA carried the entire paper work for the flat which already had all required approvals from competent authorities. Having gone through other reviews in this section, I would like to clarify few points: (1) As per RERA, any builder is allowed to make changes in the already sanctioned/approved plan after taking consent from the buyers. KEYA did inform us about their plan to increase the flats from existing 312 to 468 and removal of 2BHKs from towers B and C. They also took consent letter from us which they were required to produce while applying for modification in the plan to BDA/RERA. (2) In the case where higher floor approval was pending, KEYA secured buyer's interest by specifically mentioning in the sale agreement about their wish to modify existing building plan. (3) It is true that their straightforwardness regarding their one price policy can be interpreted in many ways.. Some may find it arrogant as well. Price, in general, is a matter of perspective.. Some may find KEYA-ATL very expensive while others may be willing to shell more money for other lesser known projects/builders. (4) This is my 2nd property in Bangalore. From my experience with other builder and with KEYA, I can say their after sale commitment is really good. Sangeetha from CRM team and Kavita from marketing team have always answered our calls/mails and gave solutions to our queries. We were promptly informed via official communications when KEYA got both BDA and RERA approvals for their modified plan. (5) Navigating through RERA website was a real pain in case of searching modified plan details. Initially, when we were informed about RERA approval, we struggled a lot to find the modified plan details. Although, KEYA had shared the RERA order for modified plan and we were able to download the same from RERA site, getting modified plan details from RERA website took some time. We can now see the modified plan details on RERA website under the tab ""Modification of Plan Details"". Just to emphasize that I am not a paid reviewer, nor I work for KEYA. I work for a very reputed semiconductor company in Bangalore."
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"Communication and attitude needs an absolute overhaul, hopefully leading to an acceptable level of customer service. You ask any questions, their standard response is My way or the Highway!! One of the only builder with a god complex. @Leadership team, the attitude, ""don't care about customers or their ask"", reflects on you!"
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"The moment we saw the floor plan amd layout, we decided to buy an apartment for our own use.Quality looks excellent and construction is also as per deadline.Great location : Near all the facilities but away from the traffic noise."
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"Very bad experience with sales lady, their pricing is not transparent, morning 11 I received cost sheet on which 10 lakh increased whe. I reached site, mentioned to me that their people who are dealing with customers are not aware about correct pricing, how ridiculous it is that they increased 10 lakh in few hours. Additionally, seems to be some legal and approval issues as building was initially approved only 12 floors and now modified approval of 23, reason for initial approval and modification was not satisfactory, their track record of not giving the all amenities of same quality also highlighted by some reputed real estate consultants. Be careful, very arrogant behaviour by staff."
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"If you are ready for pricing goof up and believe in biddin, go for it. Lot of prices are default but marked as 0 in the pricing at the time of quote"
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"When I went to check the property and the pricing they behaved as if everything was getting sold out and very few units left which was 3 months back, but they still keep calling me if I am interested wonder if they have kept it exclusively for me. Worst property crazy pricing."
R396799,1 Year,Keya Around The Life,"I chose Keya Around the Life because they promise possession this year, unlike other properties in the area. Before deciding, I visited other projects and found none as organized as Keya. The best part is their fixed price model, which is fair for all home buyers. They have excellent floor plans, especially their 4 BHK design, but even the 2 and 3 BHKs are beautiful. The space inside the houses is utilized very well. If you're comparing Keya with other nearby projects, look at the amenities, floor plan, and possession date. The project seems ahead of schedule, and November 2024 looks promising for possession. They have considered every detail, including EV provisions at every parking spot, solar panels on the terrace to reduce common area electricity costs, and greenery in every balcony. There are many reasons I chose Keya, and I'm happy with my decision so far. Additionally, all payments are made online, which is convenient and reduces the risk of fraud. I did experience a delay in communication via email, but the team reached out and addressed my request positively. Considering their busy schedule as they near possession, the delay is understandable."
R396799,2 Years,Keya Around The Life,"Fantastic construction quality. Small society so I feel it is easier to manage by RWA in future and also maintenance will also can be optimized easily. Nice all vastu compliant flats with great space in every room. None of the room is compromised in space, one can put full size bed with a lot of space left. Windows size is quite bigger. Neighborhood is great as almost all are villas or villa plot developments from Chaitanya or low rise societies. Reviews are mixed due to fixed price policy but actually this reduces hassle of bargaining and feeling anxious about reduced price offer to someone else and avoids disaparity. Builder is bit strict as well in terms of dealing as per regulation like they denied to enter before possession but agreed to do inspection at the time of handover for any issues to rectify which I feel is ok . Disclaimer: I am not from the builder team or anything, I am a real buyer."
R396799,2 Years,Keya Around The Life,"Not even a B category builder, but pricing is at par to A category. Just taking advantage of high price and sellers market. Dont get fooled people. Getting OC is highly doubtful in this project. After hearing that they constructed extra floors without approval I absconded from their site and scolded their channel partner for wasting my time on this stupid project."
R396799,2 Years,Keya Around The Life,"I‚Äôm struggling to comprehend why the apartment‚Äôs price is so high compared to the neighboring society, especially when compared to major developers like Prestige or Brigade. Spending over 1 crore for an apartment that‚Äôs just over 1000 sq ft from a builder who isn‚Äôt well-established seems unreasonable."
R396799,2 Years,Keya Around The Life,"Before buying in Keya please have a clear check with quality of constructions, the construction is so pathetic and the Builder is committing to deliver early before Rera. Never be in a hurry; do everything quietly and in a calm spirit. As we are spending in crores, we need a quality life with all legal formalities And please do not hide reviews from serious buyers"
R396799,2 Years,Keya Around The Life,"We booked our second property with Keyas and Kavita has been our only point of contact since day 1. She is one of d finest sales professionals who is to the point and doesn‚Äôt make you soft or hard target. In the real estate world, most sales people treat you with lots of butter and as you progress you see gaps later. Kavita is since beginning clear about her stance and most bad feedback‚Äôs often come when you expect sales person to amend something which they are reluctant or not permitted to. Several reviews about Kavita and it‚Äôs sad that people quote her name in reviews and call her out arrogant, she is an employee who is representing the firm, a sales person giving you brownies cannot be beyond their founders guidelines and when someone is clear and specific about it, it saves your time. I don‚Äôt even know why google reviews have to be about people and employees at a firm yet if so then I felt important to share my positives about her as well. PS: am not a builders relative or so like reviewers claim, I am working professional who bought her first flat with them at Keyas Green terraces and 2nd one now at Around the life."
R396799,2 Years,Keya Around The Life,This is my 3rd review for this builder that kajariwal always some how deleted my review ...they are looting and make foolish to everyone when we someone buy 1290 sq/ft superbuilt up then the land sharing will be calculated from 1290 sq/ft and this builder giving share on carpet area when I ask him why then very arrogance he said from where u will use all amenities...by the way u using our super build up for amenities builder is not giving his land for amenities that super built up from owners share only why you are making fool to everyone....now again after sometimes my review will deleted by them...
R396799,2 Years,Keya Around The Life,I liked how Kavita and other staff was so attentive and polite They answered every question we asked with total transparency . Some people didn‚Äôt like their one price policy but for us it was helpful.
R396799,2 Years,Keya Around The Life,"Great value for money. Location is good and best part is floor plan with a wow factor in balcony and each room. Sales and CRM team is transparent with fixed price which saves from headache of negotiations. Construction quality is clean with MIVAN technology. All 3 towers structures are up, expecting possession in November 2024, well within RERA timeline."
R396799,2 Years,Keya Around The Life,"Within a month of my house hunting, I stumbled upon Keya-ATL project and I must say that I could not find any other project that checks out most of my requirements: location is near to the main road but far enough to provide you a peaceful stay, proximity to the Kadugodi metro station, decent floor plan, quality materials for construction(atleast on paper) and ofcourse, a reasonable possiession timeline. So, yes ended up booking a 3bhk unit here. After sales has also been reasonably good. Sometimes I felt that the response from sales/CRM teams has been a bit slow but i have to give it to them that, even though sometimes late, all my concerns/queries have been adequately addressed. A happy customer. Construction seems to be going on a good speed. Hoping to get the possession as per promised timelines."
R396799,2 Years,Keya Around The Life,The construction progress is fast paced .. The communication from the CRM team is clear. The builder has kept his words for all his committements till now.. Hoping to get handover soon of Keya ATL.
R396799,2 Years,Keya Around The Life,Everyone has their own opinion. Personally I like the project and floor plan. As for my experience I suggest everyone go and visit and ask whatever you have to query. And clear your queries don't go with review and all.
R396799,2 Years,Keya Around The Life,Visited the place on a colleagues recommendation at work. The apartments are quiet spacious in comparison to what other builders offer in terms of carpet area. Also a special mention about their sales team (Kavita and Praful) who were very patient to answer every query we had.
R396799,2 Years,Keya Around The Life,Such a wonderful project even I happy with price also I have been searching from 1 yera thanks to pin click they will do lot of hard work to search project and finally I got with Amenities facing unit in keya homes
R396799,2 Years,Keya Around The Life,Layout is very good with all the required amenities in place. Pace of development is very fast and they have got all the approvals they promised. have no complaints till now..
R262396,2 Years,GM Meena Paradise,Okay kind of place. Location is good. Very close to the Newtown connector road
R262396,2 Years,GM Meena Paradise,"I've recently bought a flat here, only problem is the flight noise apart from that other things seems good"
R262396,2 Years,GM Meena Paradise,"Located near airport. Around 2kms from airport. Rooms and amenities are of high standard. Recently one of my relatives bought an apartment and the experience was pretty good. The flats are standalone apartments and 4 storied with fully operational 24√ó7 lift facilities. The rooms are of standard size with big French windows. The washrooms are pretty big and spacious. The kitchen is kinda square in dimension which I personally didn't like. But the bath fittings and floorings and wall fittings are decent and we liked it. So didn't have to change anything. The only thing I didn't like was that one has to pay a whopping amount for the parking space which I think is overrated. Apart from this, markets and stores are nearby. Cabs available every 2mins. The security guards are also good and well behaved. They take care of the plants and water them on request. Overall a nice experience"
R262396,2 Years,GM Meena Paradise,"Great Apartment, All types of facilities are available. Dont be shy buying flat here. Security is tight ! You get a very great view from the terrace! You can watch the whole Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport from there, Planes Take off on every 5 min !! Great Apartment !!"
R9248,2 Years,MRJV Palm Resort,Very very bad. For the last 8-9 months these people have been fooling the customers.Whenever u call them they come up with various excuses that they are not getting RERA permission. After sometime they come up with another excuse that RERA is not required only Completion & Compounding Certificate is enough. Now all of a sudden they return the booking amount without any reason. So unprofessional that they don't have the courtesy to call & give any explanation nor picking up calls.
R9248,2 Years,MRJV Palm Resort,Worst society to live. Pathetic maintenance and over hyped publicity to fool buyers. Please refrain from buying any property here.

R430659,2 Years,Omaxe Arcade,"This ia one of the oldest mall situated at Pari Chowk, Greater Noida even after this mall is neglected. There are very few operational shops in this mall including food chains, saloons.

Bikanerwala is also situated with this mall.

Omaxe NRI City multiplex is present in this mall, which is less crowded all the times compared to other places. This multiplex is good to watch the movie alone, with family or friends.

Your chance to get movie ticket for this multiplex is high on any day because of less crowd.

Main positive point is its location. Pari Chowk is well connected to all the places in Greater Noida or nearby places."

R401160,2 Years,DAC Silicon Valley Phase 8,"Very worst choice of Investment with this pathetic builder. They literally loot the customers in every single opportunity. I bought my villa and still hanging around with their employees. Quality and timeline of delivery is a million dollar question. They show off more than any other builder but do not live up to any commitment. Simply a loot., please stay away from this builder."
R401160,2 Years,DAC Silicon Valley Phase 9,The builder is not following RERA guideline at all. They are quoting a boxed price which is highly expensive. As per RERA they should specify RERA carpet area which they are not specifying. As per RERA they should exclude balcony or sitout space and car parking space from the built up details. But they are charging per sqft for sitout and car parking. Also as per RERA they shouldnt charge carparking or include the car parking area into their built up details unless and until they are providing a garage like car parking but the builder is charging for the same. When asked to provide detailed breakup they never rever back. Poor response.

R330671,2 Years,Seasons Sahara,Very congested project. The builder has made very little open space. Each & every corner is utilised for building apartments to maximize the profit of builder. Connectivity wise it is 4.2 km away from the station. Edit : There is only one season sahara & it is over 4 km from kalyan junction west entrance. The east entrance is 2.5km but rickshaws can't go through that route. Only two wheelers can go through that route.
R330671,2 Years,Seasons Sahara,Location was good. Apartment was newly constructed. View from the apartment was nice. Roads to reach the apartment were damaged.

R330671,3 Years,Seasons Sahara,Water problem poor management
R330671,3 Years,Seasons Sahara,"The appearance of water was very little, very little water was being received, the builder who gave 60 lakh rupees had said 100 percent that he would get 24 hours, he got it in a few days, and after a few months, 24 hours or 2 hours of water was not available and today there is not a single drop of water in any flat in the Sahara, there is no lift band, the water motor is always broken, there is no water since last 4 days. In my opinion, I would say to the builder that you will sell as many flats as you can but sell as many flats as you can.... You may say that you will earn money but... , One more to say Took 2 years of maintenance and used the entire maintenance myself Even after 2 years the clubhouse has not been given yet Isako bolte hai c..... Lagaya"

R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,"Don‚Äôt invest in this project. I booked in this project in 2013, and to this day, I haven‚Äôt received possession. The builders are corrupt, and there‚Äôs no foolproof payment system. No one listens to your concerns here, and there‚Äôs no decision-maker to address your issues. The management is completely unresponsive, and customer grievances are ignored. Delays are endless, and transparency is missing in every aspect of the project. It‚Äôs a complete waste of time and money. Stay away!"
R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,"Nice project, Maximum Carpet Area, minimum loading is the best part. Excellent Construction quality maintained by TATA. Really worth buying"
R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,There is a very bad structure that no one trusts. This site is behind ATS HAPPY TRAILS site and when ATS site started whenever SIKKA's structure was same and today ATS Project Handing over is happening STILL THE SIKKA STANDS THE SAME .

R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,Don't get trapped with this useless builder and it's projects. Karmic greens sector 78 buyers still not got the flats registration. Pathetic management. Worst builder
R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,"Still very slow progress, feel that they can not fulfill the commitment for the possession this year also"
R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,The combination of modern amenities and natural surroundings is what makes Sikka Kaamya Greens special. It‚Äôs a fantastic place to call home.
R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,Not a good builder to deal with. Taking your money while booking and after that no calls are answered by Sikka Team. Builder fails timeline multiple time and does not even care about customer. Have booked flat in other project 2 years ago and still project is in similar condition which it was at time of booking Avoid booking property.
R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,No power backup in their first project. Residents are fighting for their basic rights. Please consider twice while purchasing any property in any of the Sikka Project. P.S i am a Sikka Karmic Greens resident

The project's location in Sector 10, Greater Noida West, is perfect, with easy access to major highways and upcoming developments like the Jewar International Airport. The 2/3/4 BHK apartments are spacious and well-designed, and I'm excited to see the final result once construction is complete. I highly recommend Sikka Kaamya Greens to anyone looking for a premium living experience in Greater Noida West."
R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,Sikka Kamya Green is making people fool. They are super frauds. Looting people's hard earned money. I booked my unit in 2015 still no update on construction and delivery. They have wasted 10 years of my life and money as well and now no reply back to the mail and calls... Such a shameless group.
R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,"I have done my booking in September with tokan of 1 lkh but after 15 days rera extension expired then we hold the payment till rera extension and from November they started blackmailing us for the booking cancelled so in force we deposited 10 percent in December even when rera extension was pending and after some time they start forcing us to finance for rest 30 percent, we keep on asking them the fee receipt of 10 percent amount for 2 months but no response for that , and when we approach them more tougher then find that out booking was terminated in December itself, and they kept our money there to eat up the interest,they all our scammers and looting people on name of tata and sbi . And now they deny to restore our unit as management wants to sell it at higher prices . Worst people worst customer care, I am still waiting for my money of 2 units, ye jo 5 star 4 star review hain sab fake hain"

R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,"They are the big cheater. Please don't invest your hard earned money with them. I have invested in Aug, 2014 and its 2021 and still waiting for my flat. I have given 80% of the total cost and overall project is just 30% ready in 7 years. Please check their history in other projects. They take atleast 15-17 years to build a society. If you are ready for that then you can go with them. Sikka is a fraud company. They take money from you and do FD for 7 years and have fun on your hard earned money."
R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,"Buying a flat at Sikka Kaamya Greens was the worst decision of my life, this project was started in 2014 and was supposed to finish by 2017. But it is not completed yet. Cases are filed again the builder in NCLT, RERA other organisations but still no relief. NEVER buy any flat from SIKKA."
R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,"This place is modern, safe, and budget-friendly, located in the metropolitan area of ncr. It offers parks, gardens, and public facilities fr the welfare of residents, including children"
R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,"Best location of Greater Noida West with proposed metro station within 500 mtrs. However, the builder lacks intent to complete the project. Originally, the project was scheduled to be delivered in 2017-2018 however, even 4 years post that the project is not even 50% complete. Buyers have no option but to go legal against the builder to get their flats or their hard-earned money back. Further, Sikka has a track record of not completing any of their projects on time, as their projects in Sector-143 Noida (which launched in 2010-2011) are not complete even till date. Dont fall trap for Sikka Group and invest in project from some other reputed builder with a proven track record."
R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,"Sikka group ki property kafi strong hain , their team is very cooperative and helpful. Their design is also very good."
R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,"This is very good news for sikka kaamya greens, since SBICAP has funded the project and Tata Projects is doing the construction, since then the work is progressing very fast, it is expected that now the project will be delivered on time. Thanks."

R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,If you planning to buy a home please get away from such builders who has future plans and under construction buildings. They took money from you and let you on hold for 10 to 15 years and during this period you will deposit the EMI for you dream home. And if they unable to build flats after such a long time they will not return your money. So buy a ready to move flat without any risk. You will get instant possession. You can start living here or you can give on rent which will help to pay you the EMI.
R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,"Almost ready flats, may start delivering from next year onwards, however very far for individuals/ family working in Delhi. Above mentioned review was posted in 2018 and the flats still not delivered. God knows when they will start delivering."
R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,"Invest in Sikka property if you really want to take risk on your hard earned money. Sikka builder is big cheater and they are not going to give your property on time. Request you all, don't even think to invest in any of Sikka group property, we are facing from last 6 years and don't want you all to risk your hard earned money."

R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,To invest your money in Sikka is like to through your amount on footpath.Do not invest in Sikka group. They are cheater and play with emotions with clients. They will not give possession on time.Dont waste your money.
R49816,3 Years,Sikka Kaamya Greens,"If an option of ""zero"" would have been there, I would have given that. They just know how to fill their own pockets by cheating the public. It's been 8+ years and the wait is still ON. Guys, pls see if there's any way to form a group and let's fight being united.

R334945,2 Years,Unimont Aurum,"I have a 1 BHK flat at Unimont Aurum , there is major water issue . The society team is non responsive , the water issue is causing a lot of inconvenience."
R334945,2 Years,Unimont Aurum,"Very bad experience from registration till possession and after possession also. 1- they took maintenance before possession and till now ,we are residing here and after spending two months,I never got any proper facilities like - no proper management for garbage - all amenities are closed.And they took advance amount for amenities - no power backup - lift are always close And if you want to tell your problem,there was no responsible person ,to handle your issue , and also only one answer come from their end that convey your problem to head office and if you go their was one set answer I will check and after that no response, very bad experience,So if you want to waste your money so purchase room here"
R334945,2 Years,Unimont Aurum,"I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my concerns regarding a commitment made by Unimont during the booking process of our flats last year. On January 23, my brother and I booked a 2BHK and 1BHK flat, respectively. At that time, we were offered a 32-inch TV as a gift if we completed the registration and agreement within 45 days. We ensured that all formalities were completed within the stipulated timeframe. I have been in regular contact with your sales manager, Manish, who assured me that the commitment would be fulfilled, and I have screenshots of our conversation as proof. However, on June 24, during the possession, I was informed that we did not complete all formalities within 45 days and that the first payment was not disbursed from the bank. I was provided with contact information for HDFC Bank, which I was told had a tie-up with Unimont for home loans. However, the HDFC executive now denies any such arrangement. I have forwarded the screenshots of my conversation with Manish to his superior, Payal, but I have yet to receive a response. It is disappointing to see that Unimont is not honoring its commitment. This situation reflects poorly on the professionalism and management of your team, which is quite disheartening. I kindly request that you review this matter and provide a resolution at the earliest. I believe it is important for Unimont to uphold the promises made to customers to maintain trust and goodwill. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response."

R441241,2 Years,Sudarshan Paradise,Parking issue for not-reserved owners. No specific 4w parking for visitor/guest. Good thing is everything is near by.
R441241,2 Years,Sudarshan Paradise,"Best part is everything is near by Rest nothing good about society.Old building ,No proper administration,Every week lift issue and ppl stuck in lift.Observed recently in 2K19"
R441241,2 Years,Sudarshan Paradise,"Only indian toilet,corporation water stops at any time,bore well availiable"
R387272,2 Years,Paryavaran Complex Floors,"Absolutely wonderful stay! The homestay was cozy, clean, and perfectly situated in a peaceful neighborhood. The hosts were incredibly welcoming, going above and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed. The room was spacious, with thoughtful touches that made us feel right at home. We loved the homemade breakfast ‚Äì fresh, delicious, and the perfect start to our day. The surrounding area is beautiful, with easy access to local attractions. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience and will definitely be returning on our next visit. Highly recommend!"
R387272,2 Years,Paryavaran Complex Floors,"Buildings are pretty old, unmaintained. Extremely haunted and creppy at night. Flat Rents are pretty high. Flats are not upto the rent they claims and Flat owners are very exploitative. If anyone is planning for getting any rental flat here please think twice before finalize."
R387272,2 Years,Paryavaran Complex Floors,Unmaintained building with lots of stray dogs and litter everywhere.
R387272,2 Years,Paryavaran Complex Floors,No water supply
R337519,2 Years,Risland The Ace,"Excellent location, Latest technology, Good Amenities, Excellent construction and reasonable price compared to what others charge with same quality in Perungudi / Kandanchavdi. The prices will shoot up after Metro starts and once the Eco-park comes. To be frank the rates are rising as there are no good ready to occupy projects nearby and Appasamy and Casa Grande will take at least 3 or more years to handover. At Ace, there were lots of issues and few still exist like any other builders. But, being an international builder, they have not compromised on construction, safety and systems are well provided and taken care of. The Mivan construction is itself the Best technology now, on which The Ace, by Risland is constructed. All rooms, hall, kitchen are well planned and quite spacious, compared to many Indian builders. At The Ace, the handing over has begun and rates shot up to 12k per sq. Ft here(all inclusive except interiors). The Neighbour Brigade at WTC is charging almost 18k per sq. Ft. Appasamy at Kandanchavadi is almost 15k to 16k per sq. Ft and so is Casa Grande. Also, these constructions are touching the main road hence you may be affected by heavy noise and air pollution. The East side of ACE apartments is very Good with excellent view. A cool breeze, and clean air flows throughout the day. As we enter the building premises, we get positive vibes, which is very good. The sea view from top is a delight and dream of many, which is worth its price. Since, it's located 300mtrs inside from the OMR main road, there is zero noise pollution. Two good schools and all household items available at hand reach distance. D'mart is just 200mtrs away as a huge departmental store on same road. On the whole, I believe, The Ace is a wise decision for investors as well as the residents, and for those who still have doubts, only time will tell the story..."
R337519,2 Years,Risland The Ace,"Staying here for last 4 months. As a resident/tenant, it is getting worse. There are two different teams managing Ace. One is the maintainance office run by Knight Frank. Second is security team who is responsible for a bunch of maintenance activities like debris clearance etc. The whole placed is covered with packaging material, construction debris and garbage. Both parties don't seem to take responsibility. It has gotten so bad that in the first few months of handover itself, residents are collecting money among themselves to clear debris and garbage. This is for something that the builder and maintenance office should do. If the first few months are any indication, then things are going to get worse only."
R337519,2 Years,Risland The Ace,After sales service queries response by admin team is really bad and needs improvement. 6 months passed and stil the electricity connection isn‚Äôt on individual names. Queries aren‚Äôt attended or answered.
R337519,2 Years,Risland The Ace,"I own a unit in b block of Ace risland project. We recently got the handover from risland. We found a lot of minor concerns in the unit which was conveyed to the risland management team on 24th December during the handover. They took one of the keys and told us that the concerns will be addressed in a couple of days and we will get the key back after that. It's been more than 2 weeks now and I haven't heard back from them yet. I have been reaching out to everyone I know in the management (Mariyam, Prasad, Ashwini) but no one is picking up my call or replying to my texts. They postponed the handover by a year and a half. Finally we thought we got the unit but now this patch work delay is putting us in a difficult position. It has been a 1.5 years of frustration filled experience with Ace risland. I should not even give a 1 star review."
R337519,2 Years,Risland The Ace,"Given a choice, if I had to do this again, I will not go with Risland. My experience has been a mixture of good and bad. My overall impression is not satisfactory."
R337519,2 Years,Risland The Ace,"Sales team is very bad.They are not allowing to see our flat even after we have given 95% amount.we have booked in June 2022.At that time they didn't talk about GST.But handing over time they are asking 18%GST for EB,Sewage,water and also for maintenance charges.Government had exempted GST for EB,Sewage now.Regarding Maintenance charges,High Court had banned collecting GST from flats which are paying monthly Rs7500 and below that"
R337519,2 Years,Risland The Ace,Excellent work done by CRM team and Admin teams during hand over process. Very happy that i am part of this wonderful community and looking forward for the lifestyle living.
R337519,>3 Years,Risland The Ace,One of the worst Customer support system Ive ever seen. Very inactive and useless. Mariam and team is entirely clueless on handing over projects and no response or apologies whatsover. False delivery dates and false promises.
R337519,>3 Years,Risland The Ace,Thank God I escaped...I had enquired in 2022 but did not proceeded further.. don't know why these kind of builders playing with common people..
R337519,>3 Years,Risland The Ace,CRM office response not grateful. Visitors has to wait according to their free time.
R337519,>3 Years,Risland The Ace,"Getting closer in completing the project. Looks like tremendous work is being taken care so far. Looking forward to see one of icon landmark in Perungudi. Adding to this project if dump yard gets cleaned up with water reservoir, Eco park and metro coming in near future. No wonder to have the best place yo live."
R337519,>3 Years,Risland The Ace,"wait for cheaper resale properties which will come after handover as people who have booked earlier will reap the profit; be ready with funds, good building."
R337519,>3 Years,Risland The Ace,"I want to share the very worst experience we had with this building. We booked a flat in 5th floor and then came to know there was a garbage behind the building. They did not allow us to see any floors as they knew the smell is very bad in the open areas. We paid the advance amount of nearly 10 lakhs and when we came to know about this problem we wanted to cancel the building, they did not give back the amount. Inspite of knowing it is very bad for people‚Äôs health they have built a high floor building there and did not let us know the truth also. Please be very very careful with the sales persons. Especially Rakesh, he will manipulate things and make us pay the amount. Also, they will force us to sign the agreement very soon so that we will get trapped. I am sharing this experience because no one should get cheated by them. They are constructing this building from 2017 and still its not sold out because there were many legal approvals pending because of this issue. Be very careful before giving your money."
R337519,>3 Years,Risland The Ace,"Well developed residential project, easily accessible to OMR"
R337519,>3 Years,Risland The Ace,"Not allowing to see the project. Their attitude is very worst. Don't go for this project. They are very rude in getting money from us. If u made advance for the project. Then u can visit your proposed flat at any day. But they are not allowing. We should get prior permission. This is totally ridiculous. After you buy also if they tell like that, then you should wait and go for your own flat????? Think twice before you decide."
R337519,>3 Years,Risland The Ace,Today i had took possession in ace risland . Thanks mariyam and team for tremendous efforts you have done for smooth handover.
R337519,>3 Years,Risland The Ace,"Worst & Rude behavior by customer care manager,not mentioning the name.After spending so much of your hard earned money & the way they treat their clients is unbearable."
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"It was an wonderful experience with ACE, especially with the CRM team lead by Mrs.Mariam. I really appreciate each and every quantum of support since the beginning of purchase till we complete our Registration was amazing. I could not articulate in my words because the way the entire her team (Thameem) supported me and continue the same even today is really wonderful and handling the customers with due respect and polite in responding to the queries are really heart touching. I once again render my heartful wishes to this team and continue to the best in the upcoming days till the final handover. Thanks Rajagopalan S"
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"The project looks good. The surroundings are very promising. The sales team was excellent. My only issue was that the elevation of this building looks too simple. A few design inclusion would make it an excellent looking property but I don't think the promoter would look into it now. Looks to simple and box like. They must look at midrises in Hyderabad, Bangalore and Kochi or even their own properties abroad and incorporate that ."
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"Fantastic project, quiet loved the design and the construction. Came across here through a friend and he is right, its very spacious. Nice hospitality and atmosphere. Mr.Imfas has explained everything very thoroughly. I am very happy with service and quality. Hope we will go for it if the budget suits meüòä"
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"No transparency. Too much of customer unfriendly. Good attitude till sale deal , arrogant attitude afterwards. The sales head Karthik, says he is the superior boss and no one above him in India - they way he talks is totally unacceptable. He says I have to talk to some one in china. Pathetic. Not allowing to see the apartment - even after claiming they completed 95%."
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"I remember posting review about this project and received 20+ up votes for my review. Not surprised to see that they deleted the map and created new one and filled with fake reviews as overall project review rating was below 2.5. You should be curious and find out why they deleted location and created new one. Project was supposed to be handed over by now. Probably they did not receive enough booking to continue. Now coming to project: it‚Äôs very expensive compared to the location and facilities. Worst part is project is on the way of famous dump yard and every 20-30min at least one garbage truck will pass through the road in front with nice aroma üòÄand through out the day you will get nice aroma and flies. During rainy season, you can‚Äôt keep your window open due to flies and bad smell. Don‚Äôt book the project without looking at all these aspects of that area. Please visit the place before booking."
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"I booked a 2BHK flat in this project. Excellent location and very close to schools and colleges and OMR also. Construction quality and amenities provided by them are good . Support of staff and Sales team is very good and Staff are very Polite, approachable .My special thanks to Sandeep and Thameema and other staff KVS Seetaram"
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"I did a lot of research about buying an apartment on OMR. Then I stumbled upon Risland ACE. I booked an apartment in Tower A and I just couldn't be happier about my decision. Right from the walk in, sales people were so courteous and transparent. Experience centre shows exactly what we can expect from the apartment. I am just grateful that I have found an apartment like this to live a dream life. Thank you Ace!"
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,This is the potential home unit which would earn good name from consumers for their home units. Spec is encouraging . Their experience centre displays the easiest way to get the complicated technical stuffs . Staffs are well supporting for any questions. They want to creat milestones in terms of quality spec with less cost. Time of readiness is to be taken care by risk management. They also support easy access to bank channel.
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"Right the word go, when you visit this site you get a delightful experience and the service is amazing which is still continuing. Being myself a sales person for over 25 years, I strongly recommend for the value addition you get from strong team. Especially, Ismail and Kartik have exceptional patience and adding value to the whole exercise. After all, we are investing our life..."
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"I came across this wonderful project few weeks ago! I see that, the developer has definitely the courage to bring such a project with nice specs and ambience which I think should have ideally been inside the city!! I see value for money!"
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"The property is at a Prime location. Sales team was clear in explaining and identifying the right flat as per our requirement. They suggest you the right options and guide you through the complete procedure. Mr. Karthick & Mr. Praveen were very helpful and was completely cooperative. Overall, it looks like a great project with modern facilities and amenities.. üëç"
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"Good project with quality construction. Very spacious apartments with premium amenities. Quite near to my work place, SP Infocity. In fact it is in close proximity to many IT parks, hospitals and schools. BSR mall is nearby too. So overall a good location. We had a good experience of site visit. The staff were very hospitable and professional. A special mention to Mr. IMFAS, who explained all aspects of the project and patiently cleared all our doubts."
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"I too had Plan to buy Property in Ace - It was almost done and showed Interest to rep there about what layout I like , but day I visited to finalised ( this In duration 20-28 days max) price they hike price by 30% and started giving wage reason so to all be careful they will play around not a trust worthy organisation. They said you do the booking but refund is not possible in case you cancel ( RERA also says if customer cancels they have to return ) be careful while dealing - at the end decision is your - be safe ‚Äú not a trust worthy organisation - I too felt cheated"
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"I have visited Ace project last week with my family member. They were impressed with the kind of gesture given by the staff member. Well trained professionals and updated with the markets . And Good looking office setup , following guidelines of covid . Key location with all the facilities like hospital college , school on the OMR . If your looking for the flat with gated community this is for you with moderate budget"
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"Risland is one of the best project in OMR with all facilities nearby. The project is well connected to schools, hospitals shopping malls and IT. Sales persons are trained professionals and very polite. One of the best gated community to invest and best location to choose."
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"Excellent project by Risland. One of the best project at OMR. It has all the major facilities and IT hubs nearby. Construction quality is so attractive and lucrative because of their construction methodology, and the life time warrenty for the building. It has ample of amenities with lot of open areas (Mainly the OSR). Got impressed with the specifications what they have used for the delivery standard."
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"Have visited the property last week. Impressed with the kind of delivery standards which they are providing! Prominent location with all the facilities like schools, hospitals and commercials. One of the best gated community high-rise project should be looked on OMRüëçüèª"
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"The Ace is a project that has good connectivity to OMR. Lot of retail shops, good schools, hypermarkets and mall in the vicinity. Good value for money buy for investors and nice complex to live in too."
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"Risland the Ace in Perungudi, Chennai South by Risland India. My strict advise to others is to stay away from this for the below reasons: 1. They don't have business ethics. They force you to pay the application fees and they donot even tell you that it is non-refundable. Their sales team will tell you full of lies. Their main aim is to collect advance from you, which is non refundable. 2. The property is situated in the middle of garbage dump yard and if you buy there, you will need to live with bad smell for rest of your life. 3. The construction proposal is not a satisfactory. They will tell full of lies about construction quality. Dont fall prey to their lies and unreasonable clauses. Dont pay any advances, they will run away with it. Dont even enter their premises. You will regret if you buy here."
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,On the overall the location is decent and the project shows consistent development. The best part is the value of the property that I was able to finalize - thanks to the sales team - it definitely helped me in deciding on this property
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"I was searching for a good investment in the right property since last 1yr, at the end we found right one ...such a good environmental nd more amenities. We were seen some properties on the way and having many questions in our mind while sightseeing. But the professional in site has addressed our each and every question and educated us. Mr. Rakesh in site explained project Developments and future development with required proofs. We were convinced with his answers and we believed we took right decision and at last we purchased. Now we are really happy... To say this... Ll definitely suggest to my friends nd relatives. Thank you for the great support and keep working hard."
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"Property at best price available in perungudi with lot of future scope. One of the best construction technology they are coming up with for long durability. I have visited many properties in last two months, Ace is the property where I got full details and respect. 300m away from omr road, chaitanya and bvm schools nearby and upcoming metro at walkable distance, the property is going to be the best investment opportunity. Properties bang on omr road effects the residents exposure to open air and costed heavily."
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,I almost finalised this project and was ready to pay advance. They said it‚Äôs a MNC company and from my side I checked the facts. I couldn‚Äôt find even a single proof. I asked the staff for evidence but they never gave any proof and tried to convince me that RERA will protect me. I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs a genuine real company. I also heard from other marketing agents that they will never deliver the project to its customers.
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"As many of my colleagues commented on the location being a drawback, I decided to visit the site in person last week. Contrary to what people think, the location wasn't bad and instead, I spotted reasons to support the location of Ace project with worth-mentioning proximity advantages. It's located perpendicular to the Perungudi toll plaza amidst the developed region of OMR. BSR mall was just a 2 minute drive across and the site of its own had stupendous development circumferencing it's location. The model flat was really good. Staffs were polite and welcoming."
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,It's the worst location .. There will be foul smells since the building is very near to the dump yard and sewage treatment plant.. And I beleive the location has a good view of the dumpyard and the sewage treatment plant since it is a high rise building. I have been there in a nearby apartment around 500m(away from dumpyard and sewage plant) from this apartment and guess what! even in my old apartment we had these foul smells during rainy season. Which not welcoming ü§¢
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"Location is very close to dump yard and Perungudi STP. You can't breathe clean air at any point of time. Road for this property, corporation salai is not repaired for 2 years and it resembles testing track Mars. More scientific data could be found in Times of India, 2nd Sep issue, page 4. We live on this road. Our builder promised moon that dump yard would be closed (in 2016) and sewage tanker will move to Sholinganallur. Nothing happened in 6 years. Seevaram area in Perungudi, where our property and this one is located is worst place to settle."
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"Finally... My best selection by far to invest my hard earned savings when comparing my other shortlisted choices. Liked the Sales guy Imfes, really assistive in answering my queries, and unbiased when deeply taking me through every aspect of this project. Can't wait to see my own Ace home.."
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"Key location near the first toll of OMR and approx 200 m off OMR.Less traffic and peaceful gated community. Connected to the city and surrounded by schools, colleges, IT parks, Hospital ,etc.Good value for money."
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"First time in Chennai Risland a Hong Kong based property developer are constructing a massive project ACE bang on perungudi,omr main road. A PRIME location. Well connected to schools, hospitals shopping malls and IT offices.Good quality construction. Done a site visit at ACE .found the salesperson very polite and good in presenting the project.loved it. wonderful experience"
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,Risland the Chinese company. No ethics. Cheated me. Please be careful before buying. Now they are putting fake reviews. Please think 10 times before investing on this. Cheated me on money.
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"Though location is kind of ok if the project...they weren't able to answer quite a bit of questions i had regarding the car parking dimensions, ev charging stations spots etc. With lack of clarity on their end we decided not to purchase a property here..wasn't keen on the RWH line passing through the balcony visibly and the windows in the bathrooms were quite narrow for being able to use the service of AC or geyser being placed in the Otis.."

R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,Specs are good but location of project is near perungudi STP and old waste dump yard which is the biggest drawback of this project
R337519,1 Year,Risland The Ace,"Risland The Ace - one of the best property in this stretch of Perungudi to thrivuvanmiyur...it has a very good carpet area I never seen 1200 sft 2 bhk so big in carpet whereas casagrand and akshaya is giving a less carpet if client buys in casa or akshaya or appasamy sure it would be a loss to the buyer since the quoted carpet area is not there in reality...they pay high for the built up area but end up using a lesser carpet...so i felt the carpet area is awesome..location advantage is the major usp, road will be paved by the corporation since I got this info from the chennai corporation, and there is no new dumping is happening with in two years I surely feel this Perungudi and this project Ace would be alandmark project since the total ambiance of the area would change for sure..happy to be apart of Risland owner.."

Cheap quality materials used all across. Flat tiles all getting damaged. Seepage is common in flats, very shabby work. Drainage in washrooms doesnt have basic sloping and accumulates The external granites don't have cement under them, then have been broken on ground and fallen off from lifts. Interanal flat walls and ceilings have developed cracks within 1 year. The external building walls also has big cracks with paint all off. Even the structure seems not reliable now. Promised amenities not delivered. Basic water treatment mandated by govt doesn't work and capacity insufficient.

The interiors are meticulously crafted with high-end finishes, and the security measures ensure a safe and secure environment. The location is also perfect, with easy access to major hubs in Noida. A fantastic place to reside!"
R344889,2 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,I recently moved and it has been a transformative experience. The attention to detail in every aspect of the property is remarkable. The staff is incredibly courteous and always ready to assist. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to call home in Noidaüòç
R344889,2 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,One of the luxurious property in noida and might best one they are doing fantastic landscape. I have seen sample flat they are spacious. Its under construction property. And wonderful Egyptian sculpture at main gate of entrance lobby
R344889,2 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,This place looks awesome. I am not giving any review about their services or they are giving possession in time or not here I am just reviewing the beauty of this place. They have decorated everything so well but yeah the price of the flats are too high.
R344889,2 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,"One of the best Project in NCR
Luxury is defined pretty well
The architecture and Interiors are beautifully crafted.
zero commercial movements in front area is a very good part of the project plus the clubhouse and unique amenities.

overall it's a value-for-money project."
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,"Beware before investing your hard money with Gulshan. More than 180 homeowners of Gulshan Ikebana are suffering financially because of the false promises done by builder.
There will be many such in other projects also.
Registries are pending even after making complete payments to the builder.
Be safe!"
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,"Very impressed with what has been planned for this new community. From the various useful amenities to the low density complex, they are doing what others have not so far. Proof is always in the pudding, so looking forward to see how it all shapes up mid 2024."
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,"New High end residence in Noida. 3 towers 34 floors, 2 flats to a floor, 3 side open with unhindered view. 6 odd acres land parcel. Very good construction quality
Sector 144, less than 5 minutes from metro station and expressway"
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,Not a very promising offering. Far from sample just like other builders. Affordable luxury only. View is good.
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,"As much as the project be glamorous and luxurious in its marketing. But their customer relations area is quite disappointing. You can‚Äôt just walk-in and explore their sample. First you need an appointment and if you just drop in randomly the much hospitable staff is going to shoo you off to take an appointment and come later.
I have been to many luxurious projects never have I ever been treated this way.
And for the record it‚Äôs not like they are the only project with 4-11 Cr price range. Mahagun manorial and mulberry mansions had much better hospitality.

"
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,Gulshan Ikebana registry is pending from past 5 years. Builder just handover the property and run away with 70 crores of homebuyer money. Think 100 times before buying Gulshan properties. Don‚Äôt trust the word of employees or their Management who is only giving false assurance from many years.
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,Nice project from Gulshan. Beautifully designed n usp is master bedroom n restroom with jacuzzi. Location little offbeat .
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,"Close to nature,a very beautiful ultra Luxury project with best of the amenities.No doubt it's one of best luxurious project in Noida Expressway.
When I went to see the project ,staff were very kind & helpful.They explain each & everything appropriate manner.Nice Experience Gulshan Dynasty"
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,"Firstly let me accept it was our mistake that me and my wife visited this project to see sample flat without appointment. But it‚Äôs very simple, how do we suppose to know that it‚Äôs only by appointment.

Even after we requested that we know enough about the project and builder capabilities, they refuse to show us the sample flat and asked us to leave and come with an appointment.
I appreciate that they adhered to the rules set for the project but to my surprise they didn‚Äôt even asked our coordinates or share their‚Äôs for any future appointment and simply asked us to leave. May God bless them but this kind of attitude have not taken anyone to success. Since I know the builder capabilities and own a property in one of their project in Noida, they have surely lost a customer for life. Arrogance in sales and marketing can spoil anything."
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,"We are living in gulshan botnia just beside it, Gulshan management is not clearing the dues of Noida authority and it‚Äôs small amount‚Ä¶ Our OC/CC is due , as per their own employee in our monthly meeting they did not have good financial condition ‚Ä¶ so be cautious on their false promises ‚Ä¶ We are already seeing here ."
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,Do not fall into prey from sales team. There is a huge garbage dumping yard here. Imagine spending 5 cr and smelling garbage throughout day from balcony. Gulshan is doing nothing to mitigate this. Avoid this project unless dumpyard is shifted from here
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,Last time visited project is said to be luxurious and this next to Gulshan botnia . Builder has timely delivered rest of his project in past
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,"Gulshan Vivante Maint is still with Builder Agency, as builder has not given DOD, required for making AOA.
Maint charges increased by 33% & refusing to share expenditure details.
After sale of all flats, Maint has deteriorated.
Security is weak, as boundary wall not made in front of market, as per plan. Anybody can enter from market to residential area.
Took up with Builder, but no response."
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,Think atleast 1000 times before booking any Gulshan property since they never give flats on time and moreover few of their societies are still under pending registry and the response for the same is too lame even their owner will say lie right on your face in meetings so if you got ur hard earned MONEY DON'T WASTE ON GULSHAN...example Gulshan bellina must visit to check the authenticity of my comment..
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,"Impressed with treatment at Gulshan Dynasty & Impressed with the project as well. Greenery & open spaces are best in the project. Platinum certification which is the highest certification adds more value to this. Once handed over, undoubtedly it would be the best to live."
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,"Gulshan Dynasty's location is very serene. Although, it's in the lap of nature yet it is so very close to the heart of city.
A perfect luxurious home destination.

Looking forward with so much excitement!"
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,Visiting Dynasty today was an experience Par-Excellence. Love at first sight should be an understatement for the precision shaping up under the very able personal supervision of the promoters with their heart and soul in it.
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,"What can i Say about something i have out my heart n sweat to build upon , one of the best in entire Delhi Ncr in terms of amenities , features , location n convenience.
After completion m sure , it will be a landmark in Ncr."
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,"Last year I saw this property and last month I made up my mind to buy it ‚Ä¶once I got to know they have increased monthly maintenance and club house maintenance will be separate ‚Ä¶.so for me jump of 10,000 monthly in a under construction property which was not there one year back‚Ä¶.anyhow it was not my cup of tea but it‚Äôs a good project if one doesn‚Äôt think before spending at all."
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,"Nothing can be as good as this property. Every minute detail has been taken into consideration and we'll addressed too.

Someone needs to come and experience this. Best one in Noida!"
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,"No professional behaviour. Their main business is to cheat buyers and sell flat at any cost. They never inform us about progress of project. From last two years in Gulshan bellina they are making false promises of delivery, but they have no intention of project delivery."
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,Gulshan is known for delivering excellent quality. They deliver what they show in sample flat. Value for money deal offered by Gulshan.
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,Very nice surroundings and seems to be very good living place when ready. This is actual present status of the project gulshan dynasty at noida sec 144
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,"One of the most luxurious projects I‚Äôve seen in Noida, increasing the expectations surely for the standard of living they‚Äôre offering."
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,A premium product in the market of average residences. It surely is living upto it's name. Excellent development and beautiful location makes this project standout.
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,"It has all the advantages like location, facilities and class of living. Just a newly crafted society."
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,Beautifully designed residences. Luxury defined pretty well
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,"Now they are responding here, what's the use of that ? instead of working on the problem faced by the people who bought flats from you, You are making new project so that more people will suffer in future."
R344889,>3 Years,Gulshan Dynasty,"Location from the city centre is perfect, away from city's hustle bustle but still functional for the professionals."

R33308,>3 Years,Jangid Galaxy,Project is situated on GB road opposite to Suraj water park. Very well designed project and Jangid builder is known for utilizing space to create good Carpet area. National park view from building as amazing.
R33308,>3 Years,Jangid Galaxy,"The project has been under construction for over 20 years, yet possession is still delayed, which reflects severe mismanagement and neglect. This so-called ‚Äúsociety‚Äù is far from meeting even the basic standards of a residential community. Instead, it resembles a neglected slum, with deteriorating structures and little regard for the quality of life of potential residents. The infrastructure is poorly maintained, with no visible effort to create a safe and welcoming environment. Security is virtually nonexistent‚Äîthere are no security personnel, cameras, or systems in place to protect the residents or their property. Anyone can enter and move around freely, making the place feel unsafe and unmonitored. Additionally, the developers have failed to deliver promised amenities, which adds to the frustration. Residents who have invested in this project are left with substandard conditions and an overwhelming sense of insecurity."
R33308,>3 Years,Jangid Galaxy,"Good to see people are sharing feedback and making aware about fraud and scam of this project I had got a call for this project but after readying your review, I understood the scam Thank you all, and I wish I had power to retrieve you money from Developers But I really really appreciate you guys warning others It shows selflessness of you all "
R33308,>3 Years,Jangid Galaxy,"Delivery of amenities are delayed to unlimited time, Swimming pool plan is unknown. Developer is not or may not willing to complete the project. Society formation not initiated. TMC Water supply issues"
R33308,>3 Years,Jangid Galaxy,"Water issues,bore and TMC supply water mixing, no area to play, hotch potch kids play area prepared.The lobbies are half done and dangerous"
R33308,>3 Years,Jangid Galaxy,"Work is now fast considering all the delays. 1 tower OC received, 2 in pipeline in the next 6 months. Carpet size is large which you will not find anywhere in GB road. If maintained well in the future this could be a nice place to live."
R33308,>3 Years,Jangid Galaxy,Worst project ever. Throw away your money else but dont but here. Weak walls Leakages No 24x7 water No 24x7 electricity Theft of milk/shoes Watchman sleeping after 12pm Rats biting all the wires Honeybees every night No dedicated parking No playing area for kids No amenities No security Only spacious rooms with low quality constructions
R33308,>3 Years,Jangid Galaxy,"I have invested in this project since 2013 and was told will get possession in 2014, but till date have not got the possession and what's worse is that the flat I had booked after down payment was sold to another costumer without my knowledge. Can not trust this Builder anymore."
R33308,>3 Years,Jangid Galaxy,The Project is always delayed. not providing amenities as they mentioned the quality of works is not up to the mark .very old project 2007.
R33308,>3 Years,Jangid Galaxy,Awesome location to live in; a road touch property yet away from dust & sound pollution.. Had some rumoured doubts which were all cleared.... Nearing completion...
R33308,>3 Years,Jangid Galaxy,The construction is rather slow due to covid and in lockdown it completely stopped and right now they started again and maybe it'll take 1 more year to complete the whole project.
R33308,>3 Years,Jangid Galaxy,More than one year i visited and they said will get OC in just 2months and still no OC for tower 2.
R33308,>3 Years,Jangid Galaxy,"This property situated on prime location and affordable price and nearest of good shopping centre like a D-Mart, Big Bazaar and Pantaloons and opposite of Suraj water park."
R33308,>3 Years,Jangid Galaxy,The complex is still under making... Project got delayed by years but OC for the 3rd building should come soon...
R33308,>3 Years,Jangid Galaxy,"Worst project ever. Even after repeated complaints, no issues are addressed."
R33308,>3 Years,Jangid Galaxy,There is a lot of building and I am also very good when it comes to fruition.
R33308,>3 Years,Jangid Galaxy,Good property with gr8 location and carpet is also big

R9054,>3 Years,Akshar Altorios,"Akshar builders and its staff are really helpful. The builder was very flexible from day one of interaction and have been very open and transparent. We were searching for a home from a long time but couldn't get a completely satisfying option. When we visited Akshar altorios we felt it was awesome. We purchased one flat in Akshar Altorios. I always referr anyone to buy this property . MNGL pipeline connection is there ,Water supply 24hr , Electricity 24hr Power backup . Amenities also good ."
R9054,>3 Years,Akshar Altorios,"Overall, My experience at Akshar Altorios was excellent. would highly recommend it to anyone looking to buy a new home in Pune."
R9054,>3 Years,Akshar Altorios,"The worst society. People have several whatsapp group and they decide things on their own which is not communicated to the other people. Regular water issues and regular electricity issues. Nobody available to take the complaints. Avoid taking property here, if you can. It's been over 6 years and yet no association has been formed."
R9054,>3 Years,Akshar Altorios,"Akshar Altiorous offers more than just a residence; it provides a lifestyle filled with comfort, convenience, and elegance"

R4384,>3 Years,TVH Vista Heights,Tallest living space in coimbatore. Gated community no disturbance completely privacy. Clean & neat well maintained.
R4384,>3 Years,TVH Vista Heights,"Beautiful, peacefull, best location good work quality"
R4384,>3 Years,TVH Vista Heights,"I recently bought a flat in TVH vista heights 3-BHK, tower 12. The flat are good and spacious. Construction is also good. But electricity connections provided in the flats are pathetic....there is no symmetry at all specially for master bedroom. other rooms are fine. Also the people in charge for maintenance are not that good. Electricity provision was provided to every owner in the bathrooms apart from us. And when i am complaining regarding this no one is ready to hear it out. siting that we didn't gave electricity connection in bathroom to anyone. First of all why wouldn't the builder provide cable connection for bathroom mirror lights ? i have not seen one facility where it is not provided. Secondly this miss match of providing provisions in some flats and not providing in others is really stupid. They did not give us any discounts for not providing the bathroom light connection."
R4384,>3 Years,TVH Vista Heights,"I lived in TVH as a tenant. It was a worst experience ever, the landlord was so greedy and money minded that at the time of vacating the flat she cut almost 30 k from the advance deposit and the quality of water supply is very poor. I request please think 1000 times before living in this society."
R4384,>3 Years,TVH Vista Heights,"Poor quality of construction, bathroom fittings are horrible, drainage seems to be blocked, electrical load is not proper, damaged many kitchen appliances because of voltage fluctuation. Except for podium garden there is nothing that I like about this apartment."
R4384,>3 Years,TVH Vista Heights,"Lovely experience living here. Good ambience with garden, swimming pool, gym, park with greenery all around."
R4384,>3 Years,TVH Vista Heights,"TVH management is a very average responders to issues. Not sure of their marketing strategy, but once u become a resident of TVH their response will be so so bad. To highlight about the quality of built in items, it is highly poor. The maintenance team will never respond on time and no issues will be resolved permanently. Until u stay, there will be something wrong or not working in ur house. That is the quality of construction and response from the repairing team. Most of the good reviews are from the management team and not from the genuine owners or tenants. I would never prefer this team to get a dream house of mine."
R4384,>3 Years,TVH Vista Heights,"Purchased one flat in 7thTower..Home loan tied with SBI, Race course road branch, Coimbatore. Received excellant and quick response from Officials of TVH, Vista Heights and Bank officials especially kudos to Mr.Thiruppathi Nodal cum loan Officer of SBI, Race Course road Branch Coimbatore for his prompt service..."
R4384,>3 Years,TVH Vista Heights,"To Reach TVH heights vista via bus , coimbatore from coimbatore railway station - every 10 minutes there is bus (bus number 1C )infront of fire force office, coimbatore...it is nearly 100 metres from coimbatore railway station towards left.... cross the road and take a walk 100 mtrs from there towards left ...there is a bus stop , ask for 1 c bus in every 10 minutes... Then 15 rs ticket to rajalakshmi mills , or VGM hospital....alight and cross the road...here is your destination"
R4384,>3 Years,TVH Vista Heights,Hi saw this property in Google. Its beautiful. is there any flats available to rent out
R4384,>3 Years,TVH Vista Heights,I had booked an apartment in 2014 and still waiting ..they unilaterally change the terms of sale..the staff keep changing and looks like the management is in deep trouble not able to complete and handover the project.

R63305,>3 Years,MAAD Nakoda Heights,"Caution!!! No maintenance No proper water supply. Only bacterialized tank water Horrible neighbours, fighting each other everyday Not clean properly. Power failure twice a day If you are not believe ..go ahead and try to get this wonderful experience"
R63305,>3 Years,MAAD Nakoda Heights,One of worst complex building when it comes to maintenance no back up for anything ...hostile environment ... I have myself saved a small boy who was trapped in the lift .... residents over there are north indians ( bhayyas)

R63305,1 Year,MAAD Nakoda Heights,nice society
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,"Very cheap quality small tiles, sanitary fittings, doors and switches. Room, Kitchen and Hall sizes are also very small and old fashioned to accommodate more units. Even the new building style also looks like a 20 year old construction. No aesthetics. You can get better apartments for their price elsewhere in Pashan. Builder/investor is greedy and non cooperative."
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,Nice place for resident
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,"I used to live there. We stayed in MVG for 5 years. The Mont Vert Grande' society is a great place to stay. It is well maintained with ample space for kids to play besides having 1 big and 1 small garden, basketball court, lawn tennis court and swimming pool. There are big trees around the society which keep the atmosphere cool. The flats are very spacious and the master bedroom has a huge veranda. Parking space is apt too. People of all ages would enjoy to live here."
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,Wonderful housing society
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,"A beautiful housing society in Pashan, Pune. Nice place to live."
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,Nice gated society. With huge flats and scenic views
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,Very good residential complex. Visitors have to park their vehicle outside the complex.
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,Residence building but very nice facilities make for flat owners.
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,"Good apartment with spacious and well- ventilated flats. Society is having all basic amenities like kids play area, lawn-tennis court etc. The drawback is that layout and interiors of the flats are old - fashioned."
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,Maintenance of society are good parking area and walking areas are neat and clean üòä I love it to visit that place . ‚Ä¶
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,Great place for families to live.. Very peaceful with a great vibe.
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,Very spacious flats here Good place to visit And good view from flats
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,"Livable society with several good amenities, best of which being a tennis court. A bit old fashioned but still good to rent/live in."
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,Nice society with sufficient amenities
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,Good society to stay
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,Very reputed builders known to provide good quality construction in and around Pashan and Baner. They have been known to have provided good spacious apartments in the pastüëçüèº
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,"Society divided by main road, now builder is constructing building on other side of the road and still being an old society other one has no amenities."
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,"Good security system, spacious and decorative interiors."
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,Amazing society with great flats and views.
R44420,1 Year,Mont Vert Grande,Nice society in Pashan with ample parking and free spaces. Has a hill just behind. Very peaceful.
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,They have well maintained society. Very good amenities. All the Falt would have good ventilation and they are providing with good bathroom flooring and mirror. Only issue is with outside entrance area is not good
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"The society is well-maintained and offers a good living environment. Its proximity to the airport is a major advantage. But, there are two notable concerns: commuting to and from the society is challenging, which is a well-known issue, and the presence of street dogs inside the society leads to hygiene concerns due to frequent instances of dog poop. Addressing these concerns would further enhance the living experience."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Being a resident of this society is really good... Good amenities, spacious society.. diverse people and multi cultural celebrations for all communities. The only problem is the commute road will passed through Kalwad wasti... Narrow roads for car to pass... During peak hours the road get jammed. The builder and local corporater had assured to build a road from 509 chowk till the society in next 1-2 years..."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"A perfect place to call home. Not just the well ventilated buildings, but the wide walk areas, parks to play in, and a swimming pool, make it one of the best residential complexes in the Dhanori-Lohegaon area."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Good society with all facilities nearby. Bramha Sky City has good facilities such as Gymnasium and Lift. It also has amenities like a Badminton court, Basketball court, Jogging track, Lawn tennis court, and Swimming pool. The project has indoor activities such as a Pool table and Skating rink. It also has services like Grocery shops and Libraries. It also has Car parking. What more can one want?"
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Locality is not good.. But scheme is awesome.... Friendly neighborhood... amenities... swimming pool, basketball court, lawn tennis court, skating track, children's park, cricket net, gym, snooker table, table tennis table all are there in good condition....."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Frequent water scarcity issues. Amenities not maintained well. The area is not well connected. Flats however, are spacious."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,The owners of this project are related to Pune Porsche case. So anyone investing in new development should be careful.
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"The view and space is really awesome, nice and clean place. Loved it"
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,Its just impossible to go there as the road is through slums n full of potholes
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Very big society and also very neat and clean,but to go to society have to go between very narrow lane of kalwad area"
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Have been staying here from last 5 years, initially after coming in things were good and still they are ok but the biggest problem is issue from builders end leakages everywhere in flat and basement parking. Work quality is what disappoints you after spending your whole savings to purchase your dream home. Please take wise decision before making any purchase"
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,Apart from poor road connectivity and Sunday 3 hours of powercut everything is fine here.also nearby 1-1.5 km there is no good medicine and general item shops You can just generic items n medicines around the society
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Pros: 1. Society is good. Big open space for walking,etc. Ample of parking available. 2. Grocery shop and Apollo clinic available inside society premises. Cons: 1. Pathetic security agency 2. Approach road to society goes via a slum. Builder cheated to all and proposed DP road is still a distant dream. For new buyers, if you don't see a running DP road (connecting to 509 chowk), then don't buy flat here. We have been waiting for DP road since year 2014."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Decent apartment with all amenities including gym, tennis court, grocery shop, badminton court, swimming pool etc"
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"It's a good society to live.People from all corners of the country live here in harmony.They celebrate their festivals together.You can call it a mini India. The society has ample space for morning walkers.It has park, Gym,swimming pool community centre, playgrounds n children 's playing area. Approach road of the society is the only demerit it has."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,Nice place to live with basketball and tennis court. Swimming pool. Nice small Garden. Small children playing park. The path which leads to sky City needs improvement. Don't know when this happens as the google maps showing path and that path is still under construction. So we took a different route which was quite narrow. We reached and city is nice.
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,Society is good and quite big enough. They are coming with new building's in the society. Well maintained and well secured society. The entrance is big enough but the road to the society is smaller when compared to the population of the society band area. Amenities are present in the society. The views are awesome as you go towards upper floors. Best society safety wise.
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Sharing my experience as tenant of L-504 The owner Bipin jadhav provided flat with damages on walls, kitchen trolly, tubelight hanging with cello tape, curtain rods hanging on a single nail etc.already told him that time. On highlighting this issues, he asked to ""adjust"" but didn't get these repaired. On vacating the flat, he deducted unnecessary exorbitant charges in the name of cleaning already cleaned flat with just dusting required, repairs of the pre-existing damages etc. Ironically, these damages are never repaired. I also got to know the same pattern happened with previous tenants as well, and they had a similar complaint. He has not given any security amount to me and rubbish entire amount . This is happening in many flat in bramha skycity ...so not to suggest ..."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Not sure how this society is getting 4.2 star overall? If u check the approach road, u will understand why I am saying so. In the middle of the slum. Dirty, crowded. Why on the earth would one prefer this society? Ohh yes don't get fooled by the promise of dp road. DP road is promised from 2014, till an inch of road is not made and it's unlikely that it will be made in next 10 years."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Awesome society with all amenities. All amenities: Parking Tennis court Basketball court Skating ring Garden Kids zone Club house: tablet tennis, pool table, carrom board, gym, party hall, sauna bath, steam bath, shops, clinic, swimming pool... Power backup 24 hours water Gas connection Garbage collection area. Sometime you can feel low connectivity."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,Good residential apartments with aminetis
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,Lovely society with all amenities functioning and very friendly people. The trouble is 2 out of the 3 entry roads are through slum dwellings and are very narrow.Everyday commute becomes a problem. The noise of the fighter jets causes a boom effect as the society is U shaped.
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Surprised to see overall rating of this society. I'm one of residents of this society and i feel it deserves 0 ratings. It's not due to poor structure or lack of amenities, it's due to very very poor connectivity with nearest main road. Please do visit once and feel it. Also for new phase, I've seen advertising of planned DP road which will be made in next 10 yrs perhaps or not made. For selling earlier phases, DP road was shown infront of the society which has been disappeared after sold of flats. For new phase, they are showing it backside which will be vaporized too after selling of phase 3 flats. Don't fall prey and attract by seeing advertisement. Please do visit once and talk to some of residents. You can get clear idea."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Sharing my experience as tenant of E-501: The owner provided flat with damages on walls, kitchen trolly, tubelight hanging with cello tape, curtain rods hanging on a single nail etc. (I have video proof of all these). On highlighting this issues, he asked to ""adjust"" but didn't get these repaired. On vacating the flat, he deducted unnecessary exorbitant charges in the name of cleaning already cleaned flat with just dusting required, repairs of the pre-existing damages etc. (I also have a video of flat when I vacated). Ironically, these damages are never repaired. I also got to know the same pattern happened with previous tenants as well, and they had a similar complaint."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,The review is specifically for Mr Pankaj Rajput and Mr Krunal Patel who have handled our case in the most ethical way possible. Mr Pankaj is a dedicated and truthful employee who balances between customer expectations and the company‚Äôs benefits in a convenient way without compromising on the asset value. That‚Äôs a great skillset to learn and acquire.
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,Nice place to live but horrible service road to reach. It goes from vasti and in evening time it's horrible trafic and road side shops. If they have good service roads then worth staying.
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,Housing society located a bit inside from the main road. We visited this place for a function The road leading to the society is quite narrow and rough.
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"It‚Äôs a great society with a huge playground, clubhouse and swimming pool. The committee takes very good care of the residents. The security of the building is top class"
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,This is good residential complex. The amenities are better than any other residential society in near by. This society is very close to airport. Note:- please like the review if the information is found useful üëçüèª
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"The method of teaching driving is very good, such teachers are rarely found‚Ä¶. heartfelt thanks"
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,A good place to stay in dhanori. All the festivities are celebrated properly
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,The society is good with all amenities for family and kids. However the entrance location / area can be better. Though once u reach this place is a bliss.
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Good architecture but builder is inexperienced. I had booked the flat in 2012, got possession in 2016. In 2012, I was told that it would take 2 years to build the proposed dp road..it's 2022 and still waiting for it :)"
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"I have found this society very pleasant in terms of area, facilities, club house, parking, Security features for visitors entry."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,It was good from inside. But the road connectivity issue is there. You will enter society through a slum road. Only this issue.
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Great place, clean, well maintained and safe for kids."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Very nice society, having good atmosphere,fresh air, good aminities for children,best path for walking,sweeming pool and many other facilities available."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Place is nice, with most amenities needed by middle class people. Only problem is the approach rod from Dhanori-Lohgaon road and Airport -Lohgaon road."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Best Society, well maintained amenities, BramhaReality and Corp both are good reputed builder . Once the Approach road is done, this will be hit with in Dhanori and near by Areas."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Very dirty, no proper staff, no proper water , air smells , no ventilation, any rules unwanted applied any time without notice, reused water u get in flush, water smells like hell. Too many problems can't describe..."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Good amenities, spacious however no proper connectivity to main road, inadequate drinking water supply and CCTVs from builder, very bad smell on front driveway due to open drainage."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,Good society and flats went there to check apartment road .. but not much essential shops nearby and to approach road of society .. that‚Äôs the reason I decided not to stay there.. and switched to Porwal road instead
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,Nice place once you get inside of society. Concern is an approach road to here from the main road.
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Buildings and other facilities are satisfactory, but approach road connected to Society is bad and dirty."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,Pune's most celebrated devlopment for its most prestigious Tower..
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,"Great place.... Just beware that ur maintenance is not properly utilised and also false promise of building a road while buying the flat, just to attract customer."
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,Society is good but amenities are not sufficient
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,Nice society but the roads to reach there are not great.
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,Reaching here is a tedious task. Roads are narrow and jammed in office hours
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,Very near to airport. The approach road is an issue. The noise of aeroplanes too. Rest is good .
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,Feeling good to become a part of Dhanori's most prestigious address
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,Very poor connectivity. You can't find this society gate until you reach to 100meter infront of gate.
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,Very small studio apartments. Didn't like
R5564,1 Year,Bramha Sky City,At avery good place from the airport really convenient

R14,1 Year,Brigade Metropolis,"Pros:
The apartment is conveniently located, with a metro station right in front of the gate and several campuses in close proximity.

Cons:
Frequent loud noises, such as chanting or prayers from a nearby temple, can disrupt sleep during late-night hours (11 PM to 6 AM) on many days throughout the year."
R14,1 Year,Brigade Metropolis,"Very nice place. Laid out gardens. Swimming pool. Nice temples near by. And far away from disgusting areas such as tannery road and shivajinagar, so you will find only decent people around"
R14,1 Year,Brigade Metropolis,One of biggest residential community i know . Visited multiple times because friend stays there :) . Coming to security and maintainance will give 5star. It has car parking for visitors also and all the places filled with different kind of trees. Every block entrnace has huge space with park styled grass. Place is like full of greenish and feel relaxed after seeing surroundings.
R14,1 Year,Brigade Metropolis,Huge apartment complex and easily accessible to many places. Upcoming metro station just infront of this apartment and very close to Phoenix market city. But not enough space for flea market or events.
R14,2 Years,Brigade Metropolis,One of the best locality in Bangalore to stay with your family. The society offers enough play area for kids and teenagers.
R14,2 Years,Brigade Metropolis,"Worst society to live in. The security guards think they own us and we work for them when it's the reverse. They don't allow deliveries post 11pm in the premises and you have to go to the main gate to get. The back gate allows only resident vehicles; I was in an emergency once as I came from the hospital and needed to enter from that gate but the security denied and said to do whatever I want. Staffs are literally leeches and think of themselves like the owners, denying service requests when they wish."
R14,2 Years,Brigade Metropolis,Amazing work place and the arcade has everything. Parking is available for visitors as well.

R14,1 Year,Brigade Metropolis,Very prime location and everything you need is nearby. Its very green with ample space. However the apartments themselves are of old design and overall look old and dilapidated. Construction is rcc instead of mivan and buildings have less life remaining. Better to rent here than buy old apartment unless you get a good discount.
R14,1 Year,Brigade Metropolis,"Large 36 acre property lined with trees. Very well maintained.
On the new metro line and close to phoenix market City!"
R14,1 Year,Brigade Metropolis,"A wonderful residency with ample green space and great facilities for modern living.

R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,"Don't book here. The builder is cheating with customers. He doesn't have funds to start work. December 2025 possession, still parking not completed as on 11th May 2025."
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,"Society Is Good , Flat Is Nice & Society on Prime Location"
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,Trident tower best society in wakad
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,Paranjape finally handed over flat. It was late possession. However once entire scheme is over it will get attention.
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,Possessions are delayed for many years........think twice before investing
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,Simply fantastic and astonishing
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,Any one has created any group for trident towers to stay connected? Can you please share the link
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,Very bogus flat system.
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,Guys don't go with this builder... #Commitment not fullfilled on time. #PATHETIC #PSCL #Paranjape
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,Builder is not good and no more Brand sales team wont respond once you give money.Booked flat with false promises now Demands are stopped from last 6 months. No compensation will he provided against delay in possession. Thinking to default the loan if only Cibil score affects.
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,"Paranjape is a good name and what is offered is also decent. Due to many constructions in the area, it would be crowded and not sure how it will be handled in future. Basically depends on your purpose, if looking for your office nearby then a better option than Phase 3"
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,Builder is out of funds and he is shameless. He doesn‚Äôt give possession on time. Don‚Äôt book here. The builder is cheating with customers. Paranjape is a sinking ship now
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,No management and Always disturbing other residency people by working and making lot of noise late night.... Pathetic planning.
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,Have made investments 2 years back with false promises. do not see 1% movement
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,"I really don't know what to say, when we (all the flat owners) will get possession may be after that I can post my genuine review. For now we all are struggling to get our own flat/ flats, that are booked in Nov,2017. For now struggle is real and hectic."
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,"We have been attending meetings with the Paranjape management team, including the MD and CEO, to inquire about the status of our flats. In each meeting, we receive a new possession date, accompanied by fake promises confidently made by the Paranjape management team. It's baffling to see such unwavering confidence from them. Moreover, they continue to extend RERA dates WITHOUT seeking the consent of the customers. It's utterly shameful that, even after 6+ years, they have failed to deliver the flats. The sales team seems to operate in a world of their own, providing misleading information to lure in customers. I strongly advise against falling into their trap. I urge everyone to read the 1-star ratings carefully. Despite the passing of 6 years, the construction progress of the building remains painfully slow. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Update: 21-Jun-2023 Even after 1 year same status. We had meetings with MD and CEO, then also work is very very very slow. I booked the flat in 2017 still now I have not received possession. Only I got it FALSE commitments from MD and CEO. MD and CEO keeps postponing meeting instead of facing home buyer. They don't care about home buyer. They are just fooling the home buyer. All five start ratings from there employees not from the actual buyers. If you want to actual feedback then read lowest ratings then you will get actual picture of Paranjape. You if want to book a flat in Paranjape scheme then think 1000% times. ------------------------------------------------ Update 29-Apr-2022 Construction work is completely stopped since Feb-2022. No response from builder for why construction is stopped. Builder is doing timepass and enjoyment with customers hard money. BE AWARE OF THIS BUILDER BEFORE BOOKING FLAT WITH THIS BUILDER. IT IS NOT WITH THIS SITE. EVERYWHERE IS FAILING TO CONSTRUCT BUILDING. Only two words for this builder THIRD CLASS and CHEAPEST MINDSET builder. Don't fall in this builders name. This is NO more brand. Its pure local builder mindset builder."
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,Nice location...Work progress is visible!!
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,I am thinking to book flat in Trident tower from long time. I know the project is delayed lot and now the sales team are saying that funding related issue is resolved and they already doing compensations to the buyers. So can I go for booking? Shall I trust on Paranjape? Are whoever booked the flat are getting any compensation from builder? Appreciate for your comments
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,As compared to the cost flat sizes are too compact. Rest construction quality is good.
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,God knows üò¢Completion date of society ‚Ä¶
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,Builder is fooling residents with false promises. Do not invest in this project. Work is currently stopped without further notice on when it would be started. I would suggest think thrice before investing into any paranjape scheme.
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,Posession delayed by over 3 years. Construction delayed due to funding issues. Booking done in 2016 aud no possibility of getting possession even now in 2023. Do not go for this builder.
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,Booked a flat almost 5 years ago.. possession was to given in dec 2020 and now even dec 22 is gone .. Sad we fell for it thinking its brand and these fraudsters keep making excuses.. and here we are paying rent and loan .. and they dnt evn care to provide us real timeline.. keep stopping work.. due to this all owners have suffered so much.
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,Paranjape Builders have not met there timelines for this project at all. They are not responding to their investors at all. Pathetic. Will not recommend to invest in Paranjape to any one.
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,I am very thankful for those genuine comments and reviews. Actually I was thinking to book my first dream flat in trident due to good connectivity but when I go through these honest reviews then I realised my possession may postpand for many years so I am cancelling my token. Thank you everyone.
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,Great project but its a high price compared to the flat's carpet area
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,"Location is very good of the project, builder management is useless and worthless"
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,"project Start date was Nov 2017 now construction work totally stopped since 2020 builder not responding to queries after rera certification project extend again for 6 months commitment was 2020 still now reached only 16 floors E and F building no future when it will be complete ,"
R270331,1 Year,Paranjape Trident Towers,Commitment and Execution is in lack .. construction started since 2017 but still now work as expected ‚Ä¶
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,"Do not buy home in this scheme wing C , i have booked flat in may2018 , but no work progress yet , even earlier booked wings A&B not handovered and construction is incomplete , don't know when it will get completed."
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,"Construction work is totally stopped , booked in 2017 and still don‚Äôt know when will get flat. Had multiple meetings with paranjape families - every-time new promises - this time (13 May 2022) Mr Shashank Paranjape promised to start the work within 20 days , hope he does. Be cautions if planning to book - I would wait and see where it‚Äôs going for next 2 months and then decide."
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,Work is stopped from couple of days. Completion might take next 2 years
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,Don't book don't book don't even think to book. Go through reviews to understand why. I repeat: don't even think to book.
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,"I was about to book a flat in Trident tower, I enquired, and I cancelled. READ ALL THE 1 STAR REVIEWS FIRST AND THEN THINK TO BOOK FLAT. I read all the review comments and I inquired with one of my references, he told me all the things about the project, Paranjape group and how Paranjape is treating their existing customers. Many owners trusted the builder and booked the flats, and they are stuck in this project, and they are struggling to get a flat on time. Many people booked flats in 2017 and currently in 2022 still only 13 floors completed. I inquired the same thing with the Salesperson, Salesperson gave me very childish and foolish reasons. DON'T BELIEVE in SALESPERSON'S FAKE PROMISES. If you are thinking of booking a flat then first ask, WHY A, B, C, D construction is VERY SLOW. (Listen their childish and foolish reasons) I thought Paranjape builder is very renowned and prominent but looks like IT IS NOT. Paranjape builder is NOT RESPONDING TO HIS EXISTING CUSTOMER, NOT TREATING WELL AND NOT FOLLOWING HIS OWN PROMISES. Think 1000 times before booking the flat in Trident Tower. ALL THE OWNERS ARE STRUGGLING TO GET PROPER UPDATES FROM BUILDER. BUILDER IS ALWAYS TAKING BIG U TURN FROM HIS COMMITMENTS. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I was about to book a flat in Trident Tower, I enquired, and I cancelled.

R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,Thanks all the owners who spent time reviewing this project. You people saved new buyers from falling in this trap called trident. Kudos Ps: 2 stars for location of project
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,"Location is good, late possession2023 and 2025, 1bhk flat carpet area is too less, 2bhk is also too less area, only paranjape skim not spacious."
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,"One of my close friend booked his dream home in 2018 but due very slow construction, he is still paying rent as well as home EMI. they promised to handover keys in 2022 but till date only 1st floor constructed. as usual builder giving covid reason , which are not true as far as i know. fortunately i cancelled my booking plan. PLEASE DO NOT BOOK."
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,"Very Slow Construction, do not book flat & block your hard earned money."
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,Very slow work.. Don't book. Could have given minus rating
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,"Very slow construction, people who booked the falt are suffering a lot. Think 1000 times before booking."
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,"Very slow construction , launched in 2017 no major progress."
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,"I booked the flat in C Tower in March 2018, till date i have paid 25+ lakhs and they are at plinth level only. Work progress is very very slow. Not getting satisfactory answers from Builder too. Falled in trap with Big brand name. Really disappointing experience. Do not want to rate even 1 star it should be -100 star"
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,"We three friends booked the first dream home in our life in 2018. Among them 2 of us booked in Paranjape and the third friend went for VTP. Currently VTP has progressed toward 22 floors and we are still on the first floor. We always get the reason from builder that due to covid they have labour issues. On the other hand , Many projects like VTP , VJ etc progressed well even in covid situations"
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,"The construction started in December,2017 and it's still not even 30% completed. The work progress at the site is close to zero, the work progress is shown only when new towers are launched and new customers come for booking"
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,Paranjape builders is not honoring their commitments. Can we all form a group and arrange meeting with builder to get more clarity on completion date? Plz confirm.
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,"Hi All, Pros: Booked flat in Nov-2017. As off now not receiving any clarity from Paranjpe about completion date of the Project. Project work is going very very slow. We are struggling too much about the completion date confirmation, Pre-EMI already start, I am also paying the Rent as well, financial planing totally collapsed. Think before booking. Cons: Location is good."
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,We booked flat because of Paranjape builder. We made BIG MISTAKE by trusting the builder. Worst Experience with builder and construction. Possession date was Dec 2020 now it is extended till Jul 2023. Even not sure till Jul 2023 will it complete.
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,Bad experience while cancelling the allotment. Came at my home unannounced!!
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,"Visited in last week. Project has lots of negetive points such as there are almost 6 to 8 flats on each floor , very narrow passage for all flats. Inside a flat carpet area is less compared to price. Inside passage and door widths are very small. May be constructed By considering Mhada allocation. Don't trust only for the brand sake.."
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,I visited the project.. Seems to be very good one compares to competitors
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,Good location and nice project
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,Good project by Paranjape
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,Good project in Hinjewadi area
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,"I visited this project yesterday. Found good, looking at legacy of Paranjape"
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,Location of project is good with all required facilities and also with good construction quality. Paranjape is a very good brand and project is upto the mark.
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,I like location of this project very much.It is near to my workplace & is very convenient for me in every aspect.
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,good project of Paranjape ... I like Blue Ridge most but out of budget so choosing Tridant
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,"The construction work is stop there is no work going . Even we are trap, we are not able to buy own house and paying rent. Now they have started EMI, so we are paying both rent and EMI. This was not expected from Paranjape.Some thing is wrong...this not due to pendamic."
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,Pathetic service experience from Paranjpe. No construction since 1.5 years. They have already crossed possession date. Now giving some vague excuses. It‚Äôs Waste of money and waste of time.
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,"*Frustrating Experience* We booked a flat looking at the brand but Paranjape builder has lost that trust now. I booked a flat here in Dec 2017 , committed date of possession was 2020 DEC. Now the date is changed to 2023 Jan. Which I doubt, that they would be able to deliver. As out of twenty only 7 floors are built till Apr2021. Where as 50% of the loan amount is disbursed to the builder. No new disbursement demand is getting raised. No work is in progress from last 1.5 years. Builder is not responding, site managers gives unconvincing reasons. Work is not getting started. This is the same case with all Towers A, B,C and D . Now E and F is getting launched. Think 1000 times before booking."
R270331,2 Years,Paranjape Trident Towers,"good location, connectivity, decent amenities planned. But construction progress is very very slow. Last 3 4 months nothing has moved . current on site pic attached for C and D towers...."

R8198,2 Years,Shreeji Atlantis,Worst society ever . Do not even think of living here . Society managers make your life hell on a constant basis . They have different rule for everyone. Not at all pet friendly. Hallways always smell like garbage. Glad I‚Äôm moving out .
R8198,2 Years,Shreeji Atlantis,"My humble request to everyone: please think twice before buying a flat in Shreeji Aspir/Plaza/Atlantic. The entire building has serious water leakage problems, and the management ignores complaints once your payment is done. The construction quality is third class. Be warned!"
R8198,2 Years,Shreeji Atlantis,One of the worst society. Think twice before investing in this project. Society members are very rude and unnecessary harsh people. They have a special policy for tenant 2 BHK only 4 people can stay and 3 BHK only 6 members can stay. Not an animal friendly society. So Pet lover stay clear of this society or be ready for lifetime harassment
R8198,2 Years,Shreeji Atlantis,Once you enter the compound it feels amazing. The amenities are granted and so is almost everything. Perhaps the choice of window section could have been better or at least at par with the rest.

R98900,>3 Years,Voyage To The Stars,It's iconic. There is no such residential project in India. Must visit and Must invest kind of property.
R98900,>3 Years,Voyage To The Stars,"Worst ever Post sale service from construction, administrative team. They will commit everything while purchase but post sale you will start feeling that you are dealing with some road side builder team."
R98900,>3 Years,Voyage To The Stars,Pathetic Staff etiquette. Owners (Rohan/Umang/and some wild lady claiming to be ower) treating the guests as employees. Balloon filled with EGO in belly. Threatens without fear to the customer to thrash and use abusive words.
R98900,>3 Years,Voyage To The Stars,"Just two days back I visited this site. This is the most beautiful and excellent apartment scheme in Pune, I have ever seen. Having an apartment here in this society is just like living in a five star hotel permanently. The scheme is yet to be completed fully. Out of five towers, two are ready and the owners have shifted to their respective flats. The apartment I visited was having 4 bed rooms, living room, kitchen and servant room. All the rooms have attached wc. The ambience is very beautiful. To my surprise every building has separate reception area with beautiful lounge. The scheme is full of all types of amenities. All amenities are provided at the terrace. They have comman terrace for all the five buildings. They have at the terrace the garden, children park, green gym, box cricket, swimming pool, regular well equipped gym, common hall for small functions, jogging path, kitchen and what not. Loved the apartments and the society."
R98900,>3 Years,Voyage To The Stars,I'm a CP of this project and my client has booked one flat . Which i have mentioned the details of client? But no one has taken action on it. And sales team is with other CP they get percentage from them. Sorry others CPs do not work for them. They don't care for your efforts. No it's a tanker water .

R98900,>3 Years,Voyage To The Stars,"Mesmerizing architecture, the best residential project in Pune"
R98900,>3 Years,Voyage To The Stars,"We went to see apartment and shop, however, we were not allowed to enter the gate stating that there is no sales person available to show us around. Tried calling them on the number given on the site, but I get the message that number doesn't exist."
R98900,>3 Years,Voyage To The Stars,Best building in this side of Pune. Top of the line construction and amenities within the flat made lockdown a breeze. Once project is completed this will be the hottest property in town.
R98900,>3 Years,Voyage To The Stars,No proper supply of corporation water.
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,Everyone's scenarios are same I believe complaints should be raised in a group Till that time individual efforts will be not useful.
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,I booked a flat in Aug 2021 and rera possession date was Dec 2023 . They took consent letter for extension of project work and said consent letter copy you will receive on mail. And when contacted for the copy I got a reply they can't share because it is kept in head office .Now it's 1.5 years passed and still project work is not completed. I think it will take more than 6 months to complete the pending work . I m trying to send mail it's getting bounced. No email address for escalation is given . This is really frustrating . 1 star should also be not given for such unprofessional insensitive behaviour by such a reputed builder.
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"Good project to all age group, lifetime mountain view,prime location Pune , connectivity also good you can get"
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"Puraniks Abitante has repeatedly delayed possession, shifting it from December 2023 to April 2025 and now to August 2025 with no clear commitment. Despite constant follow-ups, the CRM team has been unresponsive and unhelpful. This lack of professionalism and accountability is unacceptable. Homebuyers deserve transparency, not endless delays and silence. I‚Äôd suggest never buy flat from here."
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,Have booked flat with Puranik builder and would like to express my experience with the Puranik CRM team is very clear and transparent. They always supportive and solve my query timely.
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"I have booked flat in 2021 which they promise to deliver in 2023 than again in 2024 and still they are delaying for possession, big thing is CRM people are ridicules even after multiple reminder they are not giving response but while payment they will start sending emails it seems like no one is here to help for investors. I think we all need to file complain against puraniks. If i will not received any response i will really put Name of each CRM person"
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"We booked a flat here for the reason that only 6% amount we paid during booking and then demands the way it came. The remaining amount we are going to pay during possession. The CRM team helped us with this in a good approach. The connectivity of the location is good, amenities they are providing with a green theme is important when we have pollution at other places in Pune. We will get a bit of relief from your daily hectic day."
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,Got all my queries and concerns addressed
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,They are not adhering to timelines as stated. RERA date is 2030. so carefully review the completion timelines and invest in project
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"Worse project ever seen with 10 towers in small area project delayed by 3 years now with limited visibility on handover to owners, no water supply for uses and drinking you mist have to rely on tanker only, so many street dogs in evening with no control...don't go even and put your hard earn money!!"
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"Worst builder ever, completely fraud. Don't ever even dream about booking a flat with them. 5 years already gone, with no sight of possession in next 2 years. Stay away from this scammers!!!!!!!"
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"Pathetic team ,no timeline is followed , we booked flat 4 years back still waiting for possession, the rera date is also crossed, it's just frustrating experience"
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,This builder has zero sense of construction timings. Their new project at Bavdhan has become a menace to surrounding residents. They are literally using heavy machinery at 10pm. This happens multiple times in a week. I'm sure the builder is enjoying his peaceful evening unbothered about the noise pollution his reckless work ethic is causing!! That's the least one can expect from a reputed builder.
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,Puranik's name is getting bigger so we bought a flat in 2022 And now possession 2024 due date is fixed..2025 He took bookings by lying. And then extended a year by saying grace period. That means rent will not meet.. Don't buy these properties.
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,Dont buy property here. Its a fraud. Sales team and CRM team said possesion is in April 2024 at the time of booking now they are saying April 2025. Eveytime CRM team gives false commitment. Now they are saying as per RARA its April 2025. Dont book flat here. Save your hard earned money
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,Good project. Amenities and green landscapes are just wow.
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"Worst !! Scam !! Fraud !! I have never had such a bad experience with a salesperson in my life. I feel the behavior to be very frustrating. I had booked flat on end of July due to some reason I cancelled my booking on next day. Salespeople committed the amount will be refund within 2 weeks after I followed with the 2 weeks they are saying amount will be refunded after 45 days again I followed up on email and call then they are not giving me response after that salesperson saying amount will be credited after 60-70 days. Then I visited on Puraniks sales office, but still salesperson giving fake reasons and weast my time after 1 hour conversation, salesperson saying amount will be credited after 80-90 days. I am too much frustrated now still the amount is not refunded yet and they are not receiving my call and messages. I am the not only one person they are playing with customer emotions and giving false commitment to every one. There was a lot of bad reviews for construction and too much leakage issue, very very poor response from salespeople."
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,Worst builders ever. Scam sales team. Careless CRM team. Ugliest combination. Initially sales team will fool you telling unrealistic information then CRM will continuously follow up for payments but at the time of possession they will keep delaying it.
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"Expected possession date was June 2023, builder has now said that the possession would be moved to June 2025 that too with partial oc. Builder has been giving false timelines from the beginning. I have booked this flat in December 2019 still there is no sign by when they would be handing over the said flat. Apart of the delay they have also extended the floors from 22 to 30 without any approval from customers. I highly urge not to book flats under this builder better go with ready possession flats. Very poor management."
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,Worst experience. All fake promises. No water. Society is dependent on water tanker. Think before you purchase.
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"Harsh Realities of Dealing with Puraniks Consider this a warning about Puraniks. Their guarantees are unreliable, and their customer service is worse. After failing to secure a promised loan, they swiftly cancelled my booking and imposed a hefty fine on the agreement value, which was more than just unfair‚Äîit was devastating. The ordeal took a severe toll on my mental health."
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,Water supplement problems and annoying sharing parking fact .. stay on rent as better option
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,Builder is fraud and don‚Äôt waste your money. Rather save and earn interest
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"This is to inform all customers who will be booking flat in Praniks Abitante bavdhan that delay in possession is being caused from builder side wherein customers are given incorrect possession dates. This is happening due to increase in FSI from Puraniks End. Initially at the time of booking, customers are told that the Flat keys will be handed over to us by max by August 24 End (November 24 being the possession date as per agreement). Now, due to increase in FSI (no of floor rise), we as customers are been cheated stating various reasons. There is no communication to the customers for increase in FSI too. This is surprising that customers are been fooled initially by such reputed builders like Puraniks only to book the flat. Although paying all milestones on time, this is straight loss of customers for 1 year as Puraniks is making profit by increase in FSI. Not acceptable as a genuine customer."
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"I had booked a 2BHK apartment at Puranik Abitante, Bhavdhan. However, I canceled the flat after 11 days and informed the salesperson via call and WhatsApp. My reasons for cancellation were delayed possession, high price, and reduced carpet area. After canceling the flat, I was informed that according to Puranik builder's rules, the refund would be processed within 45 days. I waited for 45 days, but suddenly I was told that since I did not email the CRM, they would not refund my money. After 5 months of disappointment, I took action and went to the police station. The police officer called, and the builder finally refunded my money. Please don't waste your time and money. be aware."
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"Very bad Builders who always cheats with buyers, initially phase2 was planned with 15th Floor and later they increased to 30th Floor?? Committed date of possession is delayed by 3 years from Dec 2022, they have mingling with Rera team hence no action is taken on builder?"
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"Terrible experience with extremely poor construction quality. Once you book the property, no one is there to address your concerns. They have not completed the flooring of the staircase. Despite being aware of their poor quality, the MD and builder show no concern, as they believe people are easily deceived and they have a steady stream of customers. It's been two years since possession, and they are still reluctant to hand over the parking. Please visit their projects in Pune and speak with previous buyers like me. Don't waste your money and energy with these people."
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,Nice sales team. Gaurav and Prashant were really transparent and informative. I paid token as I really liked the property and design layout But unfortunately the possession date was not fitting my needs so had to cancel the booking. The sales team promptly returned the token cheque as promised. I really would recommend this property for its design and construction quality and connectivity with the city
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"Worst builder giving fake promises and not completing possesion on time I have booked flat in 2021 with fake promisies that it will complete in Dec 2023 but they are now extending floor and also not giving fixed posession date My suggestion for future buyer don,t purchase flat from these builder"
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,I have booked flat but still not received any possession and now asking for consent for adding more floors. Let me know if anyone is facing same problem so that we all can discuss the same.
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"One of the worst builders in the area. Waiting for possession since 4+ yrs, might take another 2 yrs to get possession. Completion of whole project will take around 5+ yrs from now. CRM people won't take your queries. You will be treated as it's your mistake that you choose us. Sales people will fool you with unrealistic things and you will be falling for such false talking. Be careful, be mindful, stay away from this property. Look for other good properties around. You won't regret paying a little more for your property with other builders around rather than struggling with Puraniks."
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,Puranik builder is fraud builder... Pls don't purchase any flat from this builder... At the time of booking they commit you all false promise and in agreement they smartly change his promise... Which is really unprofessional. Pls pls pls don't deal with puranik builder.. Due this builder i suffer huge financial loss..
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"Our experience with Puraniks has been nothing short of a nightmare. Initially enticed by their sales team's promises of a dream home, we eagerly made our booking. However, what followed was a series of broken promises and unfulfilled commitments. Firstly, despite assurances from the sales team regarding minimal deductions from our down payment, we were shocked to find that the reality was far from what was promised. The deduction exceeded a staggering one lakh rupees, a significant amount that was never disclosed during the sales pitch. This blatant discrepancy between promise and reality caused immense mental stress and financial strain. To compound matters, the CRM team's incompetence further exacerbated our ordeal. Not only did they cancel our booking without valid reason, but the process of obtaining a refund for our down payment turned into a bureaucratic nightmare. It took an agonizing four to five months of relentless follow-ups and running from pillar to post just to receive a fraction of our initial payment. And even then, we didn't receive the full amount owed to us. Our trust in Puraniks has been shattered, and we caution anyone considering their services to think twice. Their sales tactics are deceptive, their CRM team is inept, and their customer service is abysmal. Save yourself the mental anguish and explore other options."
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"Luxurious flats with no water and high maintenance. In fact, this is not a society worthy of a star."
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"Don't waste your hard earned money into this project. I have booked my flat in 2021 and till now only 5th slab is completed . And in the rera they have already taken a date with the extension of 5-6 years. Why rera has giving such extension don't know. But this is totally ridiculous. While booking, The builder promised us to be done in 2025 but this will definitely not completed as per promise. Even from last year I was trying to cancel the flat but the team is not responding to your queries and they are busy with making money by selling flats.. don't go with this builder.This is my big mistake made in my life to book a apartment in this project."
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"Please help. I really am tired requesting them for refund. I am begging for support for our refund of booking amount. We cancelled flat within 8 days as mentioned in their policy. We booked in August 2023 , it's been more than 7 months. "
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,Bad sales team. I had one of the worst representations of the project. The sales team wasn't even interested in selling.
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,Very bad experience Cheapest no satisfaction my friend bought a flat in Puraniks Aldea Espanola quality for the flats is very poor common amenities are very low quality for reference please visit the latest tower made by Puraniks near Orchid hotel. The builder does not care for health safety and basic amenities as well
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,Very bad builder ever seen. At the time of booking sales team assure many things after booking no one entertain. Project will get delayed for sure for more than 1 year ahead of aggreement date and no one listens to you or provide any compensation for the delay. 
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,Third class builder... Bad experience.... Last 5 years site stopped..... Don't purchased anyone flat....
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"ZERO star .. Worst experience , booked 2 BHK flat in Jan 2021 but from past 1.5 year, no construction of respected building is going on.

R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,I have booked 2 flats in Puraniks Abitante Bavdhan in the year 2021 and it has been a very bad experience so far. in last 2 years only parking area slabs (2 floor) are done and there is no progress further. Only one demand raised in the year 2023 and when ask about the reason they are giving the standard answer that due to material shortage it is getting delayed. At the time of booking they are promised to give the possession by end of 2024. But looking at the current progress not sure if we even get it by end of 2025. Vey bad management and customer support.
R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"Water issues, Heafty maintenance charges, Parking issues, more importantly stack parking issues, heavy charges for stack parking maintenance and unreliable stack parking."

R95006,>3 Years,Puraniks Abitante,"Worst living experience in puraniks abitante. Poor quality construction. I suggest don't buy flats in new phases. No munciple water supply here.

R18722,1 Year,Lodha Palava City,"Don‚Äôt buy flats from Lodha builder, you will be cheated after buy flat from lodha. I bought it in Casa Rio project 7 years ago and can‚Äôt sell because there is no buyer and people are selling flat at lower price compared to purchase price. Can you imagine Lodha exit after selling all flats now people are living in bad conditions no maintenance of buses, club house, roads, parks all are in very bad condition. I feel hopeless after buying flat from lodha so please request don‚Äôt buy flats from lodha project. Lodha is a cheater. All gardens conditions are very poor. Parks are in very bad conditions. Bus conditions are very bad. No maintenance of internal roads. We are paying very high taxes as flat maintenance, federation charges, club house tax, municipal taxes and no service at all."
R18722,1 Year,Lodha Palava City,"Purchasing a flat in Palava Phase 2 has been criticized for several reasons: Exorbitant Charges: Residents are required to pay high City Governance Charges (CGC) of ‚Çπ3.80 per sq. ft., in addition to society maintenance and club fees. These charges are mandatory, and non-payment can lead to penalties such as blocked parking, disabled smart cards, or clamped vehicles. Property Depreciation: Property prices in Palava Phase 2 have reportedly dropped significantly since initial purchases, with flats now selling at lower rates compared to their original prices, leading to financial losses for buyers. Lack of Transparency: Residents claim there is no clear breakdown or rationale for the CGC charges, which adds to their frustration. Restricted Resale Options: Selling a property is reportedly difficult without clearing all dues, including CGC and fines, further complicating exit options for owners. Accessibility Issues: Poor road and traffic conditions make commuting to and from the township time-consuming. Governance Concerns: Palava operates as a ""smart city,"" leading to limited intervention from external authorities like police, raising concerns about private security practices. These issues have led many residents to express dissatisfaction with their investment in Palava Phase 2."
R18722,1 Year,Lodha Palava City,"This is the society where you will cry after buy flats. You have to pay 5 types of taxes when you have completed your 5 years. 1. Building charge ‚Ä¶. 2500 per month 2. CGC charge ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 3000 per month 3. Club charges ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..1000 per month 4. Gram Panchayat charge ‚Ä¶ 500 per month 5. If you have car:- clamp charge 1000 per clamp. They give the parking in MLCP which will not be usable because distance of MLCP from your building will be half KM. In rainy season you can‚Äôt park there and you have to pay 3 times in one month i.e 3000 in one month. Total mount is 9,500 per month. You can‚Äôt imagine how torture is this. Don‚Äôt choose Lodha for living. You will die at least 5 years earlier due to stress created by Lodha. If you can‚Äôt pay on time they will charge you 18% interest too."
R18722,1 Year,Lodha Palava City,Worst place . Insecure for tenants. Owners are poor people of Mumbai they have no rights or idea about society. They only purchased by emi and depend on rent to pay emi . Management is only for looting society fund . No other work they did. Really very disappointed about this type of society. Please No one from other state try to rent here. Better you should try in other places except palava and Dombivali. It's not secure.

R18722,1 Year,Lodha Palava City,Pathetic quality of houses. Even a small time builder would do a much better job.
R18722,1 Year,Lodha Palava City,Worst construction quality.. Constant noise from around and the above houses due to screwed up construction. Lodha's quality is the worst amongst all the builders. The buildings will definitely fall anytime soon. Even the staff to manage the complex is incompetent. Very scary to stay in Palava Lakeshore Greens.
R18722,1 Year,Lodha Palava City,"Pathetic township! The construction quality is so bad that you can hear constant noises from the neighbour's house. Even if someone walks in the house above yours, too much of noise can be heard because the roof and the walls are very thin. The walls and the roof are not at all strong, so the buildings may collapse anytime soon. Stay at your own risk in Palava."

R18722,1 Year,Lodha Palava City,"What's that place my words has no capacity to describe it. Firstly this area is covered around 4500 acres land area , this 4500 acres includes neat and clean roads , luxury amenities, dombivli's best mall Xoeria Mall , Cricket turf , Football academy, Swimming Pool, Best Schools etc. . . and it is true that the Palava City is best place to invest ,to live, to travel and to settle."

R18722,1 Year,Lodha Palava City,"When someone tells you that the price is all inclusive, that's it 1.. Two maintenance of Society (minimum Rs. 10 per sq. ft. per month) and City (minimum Rs. 6 per sq. ft. per month), 2.. 10 thousand for each floor above the third floor, 3.. *""Compulsory""* Club Membership of 3 Lakhs, (Part of which is 1.5 year maintenance in advance) 4.. Car parking, Some other things are not included... Everything we build you in this *""city""* (ie school, hospital, market, club, etc.) use that or else you will get everything outside the city. (Which will be at least 2 km long!!) We give everything best. (You find out which one is the best and decide how expensive it is or it is 2 km away) Now the issue is home. We also make it as we see fit for you. The space we provide for wardrobe (in both bedrooms in 2 BHK) fits your clothes and belongings (a Godrej double door closet will fit in the same space) and the rest has a window. Otherwise we have another big house. (2.5 BHK) According to Vastu, number 13 does not come in my life as I am very religious. It is said to be inauspicious. So a building of 18 floors is actually 17. 1 to 12 then 14 and so on. But... But... most of the kitchen doors are in front of the bathroom door. No house is square. 1, 2 cuts are given in all directions. What kind of architecture to see in it? ch: And yes, even if you book the house, give the token, even if you pay half the money, you don't get the key until all the transactions are completed (even after a few days). What's more, you are not allowed to see the house you have bought. Why don't you stay straight!! As our policy is... we set everything once we get all the money. It installs commode, basin, etc!!! Now for the good stuff: Kitchens are built well. Bathrooms are well built. Water pressure is good. Faucets, commodes, basins are good. Everything is available within the city. If you like it and can afford it, then it is best. I want my own car or bike. At least the bicycle though. Everything is very long. For working class who do not work from home and have to go to office, book with lot of thought."

R18722,1 Year,Lodha Palava City,One of the good places to live in dombivali area. The place is well maintained and the streets clean. There's a mall connected to Palava city called the Xperia mall which usually witnesses high footfall on the weekends and evenings. The area is well secured and managed. In fact there is security for each building and digital access to enter which makes it a safe heaven for elderly people. One of the drawbacks here is that you may have to walk a little for regular shopping and to the mall. Ample parking space and gardens. There's a club house as well with a swimming pool. Which is cool. Also you can easily get cabs etc on uber or ola in this area. Overall the place is good to move in if you are working near the dombivali area. Thanks.

R18722,1 Year,Lodha Palava City,"Palava City by Lodha is an expansive township, covering an impressive 4,500 acres, making it one of the largest in the region. Within this vast expanse, residents can enjoy a wealth of amenities that enhance their quality of life. These include well-equipped schools, accessible hospitals, fitness centers, a clubhouse for social and recreational activities, beautifully landscaped gardens, a shopping mall for convenient retail therapy, and a tranquil temple for spiritual solace. One of the standout features of Palava City is its superb ambiance, complemented by numerous children's play areas, adding to the family-friendly atmosphere. The proximity to a river and the surrounding mountains ensures residents can relish the beauty of nature and breathe in fresh air daily. There's no shortage of recreational options, with jogging tracks catering to fitness enthusiasts. Ample car parking facilities are also available to meet residents' needs. Negatives: However, it's important to consider certain drawbacks associated with Palava City. Residents have reported concerns about the poor construction quality of flats, which can impact the overall living experience. Complaints of water leakage and seepage problems add to these issues. Connectivity within the area is notably deficient, with bad roads and water clogging during rainy seasons. Additionally, the evening hours often witness heavy traffic, causing delays for commuters. These challenges should be carefully evaluated against the positive aspects when contemplating living in Palava City."

R18722,1 Year,Lodha Palava City,It's a good residential place to stay but definitely not great as advertised by the Lodha Builder. Basic facilities are available inside. Main problems are you can't use the stadium as either it is rented for sports activities or closed rest of the time. Swimming pool is closed or not ready for use most of the time. Theatre is non functional most of the time. Lodha has removed the ATM present within the premises and started a Samosa & Bada shop few months back. Lodha has also started an auto rickshaw stand within the premises which creates nuisance and feels like a very cheap place to stay in. Excessive number of dogs within the premises is a very big problem. The cons are endless...

In this, the new project will be delivered and the new project will be launched. Never trust on Signature global, This will give you the same rate as other options."

R153975,1 Year,Ansal Sushant City,Very nice place. Wide roads. Main advantage is its location. Good brand name. Pollution free if we compare to Delhi. Enjoy clean air. Rapid train will be a plus
R153975,1 Year,Ansal Sushant City,The worst place to Live ! If you want to torture yourself and your family please come live here. There's no maintenance not electricity ever at this place. They cut electricity at the middle of the night in the name of maintanence sometimes it doesn't even get restored in the given time not even that there's no street light so people from nearby places come sit in the middle of the road and drink totally not safe as I have seen fight happening alot of times. Just not livable area for you alone or your family. Don't keep your hopes up!
R153975,1 Year,Ansal Sushant City,"The worst location to live. Please never move here you'll regret your whole life. There's no street lights, no security and no maintenance and there's no electricity ever all you'll receive is few hours of electricity a day and then a major power cut even the inverter runs out of battery."
R153975,1 Year,Ansal Sushant City,"The worst place ever I have seen, no doubt its peaceful but it's the peace before storm what you will face if u try to live here. 1. Unnecessary high rates charges 2. Monopoly 3. Liar 4. Huge problem of water and electricity supply Giving 1 star is not worth it for this place Need a really proper management of it That's all so be aware before taking rooms into ansal shushant city"
R153975,1 Year,Ansal Sushant City,Very well maintained and peaceful area
R153975,>3 Years,Ansal Sushant City,"Not safe , drunk people on the streets everyday. Not safe for families. It's a jungle. I don't recommend. There's no proper light too"
R153975,1 Year,Ansal Sushant City,Good place .. Pollution free finally able to breathe
R153975,1 Year,Ansal Sushant City,QUITE PLACE SURROUNDED BY GREENS AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS..WOW.....
R153975,1 Year,Ansal Sushant City,"No maintenance by Ansal builder and I don't think they have a bigger housing association to maintain it as there are very less houses built. The whole Ansal sushant city is like an abandoned place between two villages, but prices are higher than TDI (not sure why). However, this is not the ideal place to live. If you go to ansals website you will see an old 2005 brochure which claims this place has community center and club for community, however, there is nothing like that. Just rough land in place of community center. You can imagine the progress in 13 years. People are willing to sell their plots but no buyer all due to the negligence of Ansal API"
R153975,1 Year,Ansal Sushant City,"I wish I could leave zero star but it's not possible. Have you ever heard about ghost town in China? If not, google it. The ansal sushant city kundli/sonipat is worst than that. No development from past 15 years. When we purchased villa Ansal promised us with clubs and community centers, roads, infrastructure within 3 years of our purchase, but it's been 12 years and all we see is agriculture land. The condition of villas is lethargic and any mindful builder can confirm that. If you want to know about this place, do not ask any property dealer, visit nearby villages and ask people. They will tell you the real thing. I urge those few people living in ansal sushant city to please help others from getting conned through these dealers. To everyone else looking to buy property here for living, I request you to think 100 times before spending your hard earned money. An investor can bear the loss, but what about the person who is spending all his money to live here. Where he or she will go. It took us 5 years to sell our property. Dealers offer villas for 80 -85 lacks but the truth is you can't sell it back for even 60 lacks. The actual price is 30 lacks in white and after 15 years the property is not even worth 50 lacks while other ncr places live gurgaon, noida, greator noida flourished with double tipple price (in crores). I am sharing my personal experience. Ansal API abandoned this society long ago and they will abandon their other projects too. What hurts the most is the real eastate agents have no sympathy for people, they just want to cone people; they don't a heart. If you want to buy a cheap or affordable property, better invest in TDI city. However, TDI also has its disadvantages, but resale is good, the builder is responsive, upgrades infrastructure. The only struggle in TDI is it's vastness. It is too big to maintain properly, but TDI city has wonderful club, great communities in kingsbury. Do remember that all this was also offered by Ansal API when we purchased our villa, but nothing completed; not even a single brick. Talking further, visit ansal sushant city at night, the outer highway has no street lights in this area and the whole city looks so horrible and haunted. We can't properly express the horrifying experience we had. Purchase plots or appartments in TDI city instead. For investment, you can go for villas in greator noida and rent a flat in rohini. That would be fruitful. I want to write more but it's already very big review. If you want to ask more, you can reply and I will respond"
R153975,1 Year,Ansal Sushant City,Really such a nice place I have bought a plot 250sq yards last year in b block near sunshine county. I am telling you because it is far from highway. We feel comfort in peaceful place. Metro not so far You have to use sharing cab or pool right now Schools are too good my daughters studying One word feel very good than noida.

R19188,1 Year,Kundan Eternia 6,"Worst builder. Doesn't listens or care for neighborhood. Construction started 12 years ago and still going on without following any PMC Guide lines. This builder is no 1 in construction sound pollution, air pollution.They work as if no people are staying here and make loud noise by hitting hammers day and night This builder took existing roads of neighbors and gave pathetic road worst quality on drainage and all drainage water comes on road and enters eternia in monsoon Pls do not fall for reviews it's all paid up. Will not get value for hard earned money. Nothing much to do in this area-Ghorpadi goan."
R19188,1 Year,Kundan Eternia 7,"Nice luxuries flats and pleasant society. At the same time, its painful to deal with all the lazy engineers to get the work done. After a while dealing with engineers, we have lost the hope to get Nice luxuries flats, now we are just hoping to get flat as soon as possible."

After a while dealing with engineers, we have lost the hope to get Nice luxuries flats, now we are just hoping to get flat as soon as possible."
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,"The location of this society is its USP, it‚Äôs great. The flats are spacious. However, there is hardly any space left for amenities or recreational activities. It's just a row of buildings. I won‚Äôt consider it a premium project, but a decent project at premium location. Photo I have added is view from top floor on the pancard club road side."
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,"It's incredibly frustrating dealing with the 24K Sereno builder. They haven't given possession on time, there's no communication about the delay or deviations, and their customer service is awful. Their poor customer service only compounds the problem."
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,Fraud number1 Quality of construction is too low The building can last not more than 12 year's It comes under reconstruction after 10-12 years
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,"Overall the hype is too much about the society. Though the construction quality is good, there are some cons as well. Will start with pros 1. Good construction 2. Decent room size 3. Cleanliness OK 4. Security good 5. Good atmosphere and occupied by decent families. Cons: 1. Not many amenities for kids. Not ideal for kids 2. Gym - not many equipments and not well maintained 3. Place near clubhouse- Not apt for kids to play or not allowed 4. Still under builder maintenance , only one car cleaning team is there and others are not allowed , they threaten others even if residents try to bring any other car cleaning person."
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,Almost nil amenities...only name sack...club house not maintained at al
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,It's a beautiful and a premium premises. Large size well designed apartment. Beautiful lobby. Only issue felt is parkings for visitors vehicles is not allowed and I see not available inside due to a large number of four wheelers of the inmates.
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,"Decent location, spacious layouts. But found overall ambience bit dull for what is being marketed as premium project. Also there is no sample flat which makes it all the more difficult for the buyer to make any decision."
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,Highly aggressive sales team would look down upon you. And won't ready to show flats judge person by their looks.... pathetic. I can't believe in this Era their thinking is too low
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,"""Pet Friendly""? No. Do you know while this society allows pet parents stay in the society with their pets, but they make sure to cause practical and mental trouble guaranteeing one unpleasant living. Pet owners please don't consider living here."
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,Construction quality is very bad . Majority of the Apartments face this issue . The houses that are locked or previously occupied stinks because water from master washroom seeps to master bedroom with fungus growth. We are trying to get the seepage issue fixed from last 1 year with repeated follow ups but in vain. The parking is not yet allotted and it has been probably 3 years from possession . The CRM is non cooperative. The message to this complaint will be plain routing to an email or CRM number which is of no use because everyone has tried to contact that number üò±
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,No space for children to play ...only Flats but that to badly effected by seepage in rain days ....overall not good to residence young generation.
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,"Not much of a critique, to write reviews for someone. However, this one deserves a special mention. I visited the 24K Sereno project twice and shortlisted an apartment.I then proceeded with the negotiations to finalise the deal. The point of contact, Ms. Prachi Surve and myself negotiated for a final price in two weeks time. On reaching the final price, we requested for 8-10 days of time to make the payment of booking amount. I also mentioned to pay a token as commitment to freeze the price (which she outrightly denied) and pay up the remaining amount within the time limit. The lady mentioned she would get back to us with the dates, for 2 days there was no revert. We call her and she drops a new price, straightway hiking 2L stating that this is what we need to pay now. To our utter disbelief, we were shocked. After, reaching a consensus within a day the executive backs out on the commitment. We requested her manager to be present in our discussions and on both occassions he remained unavailable, stating he was 'busy' with other clients. The sales staff is incompetant and irresponsible to say the least. If the first point of contact between the customer and the developer is of this sort, god save the customer. Even before paying for the apartment this is the level of arrogance, can't imagine the situation once the dotted line is signed. Hope, the prospective buyers keep such factors in consideration while dealing with these guys. The property might have its pros and cons but if dealing is not done in honesty, it is bound to get you disrepute."
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,"There are some horrendous people in the society who wouldn't like you and your dog/dogs in the surroundings or even outside the premises because apparently street dogs will bark at your pet and it will spoil their peace. I'm a legitimate resident since approx 4 years now, would highly advice to be slapstick against those inhumane individuals yelling about your pets if you are truthfully following basic legal rules."
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,"The possession date is postponed to June, 2025 from Dec, 2024 and no work is initiated. Since no work is initiated, it is possible that possession will be delayed further. At the time of sale, the possession date promised was dec 2023, I think looking at the current proceedings the possession will get way beyond 2025. I have purchased a flat here almost a year ago. No notice of possession delay was provided. After visiting site and enquiring the details, this information was surfaced."
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,"First off, Baner is an ethereal location in the Western Ghats. 24K SERENO adds to this scenic beauty with optimized spaces feasible for families. After roaming through the complex, I couldn‚Äôt have been more convinced that this is a perfect solace from the chaotic city life"
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,"Btw, Building E possession date has been extended till June 2026 from December 2024. This has been updated on the Maharera website. Although no communication is there to update clients."
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,"I have purchased flat here, building quality is good, but as compared to other projects builder has not even started greenery, there is no way project and premises look luxeries which they claimed before. Disappointed with that."
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,"A beautiful society in baner.Nice location with beautiful view.They have all amenities.My friend stay here and trust me, flats are too spacious with a view of mountain which one can hardly find in metro cities.People who want a flat near by baner,I would suggest if you find any flat here please go ahead and visit.Kids have best place to play as location is not so crowded."
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,"Stayed here for 2 years and it was worst decision ever.... Security staff over here is disgusting specially maingate watchman Ankush and B building Pawar...they will call ""Matadi kamgar"" people during your shifting and these people will demand 1000rs just in the name of union.. Pawar and Ankush have their share in this ! We had to face so much trouble while shifting in and shifting out.. No delivery is allowed after 10pm so you have to go till main gate everytime after 10pm.... Anyone planning to shift or buy flat over here please beware.....Society management is hopeless specially (Pawar & Ankush)"
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,Was considering this for a 3 bhk as it's HSBC approved but after reading the reviews regarding pets and dogs I can't invest a penny in this. Such a good name and pathetic people who manage this.
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,"One of the best project at Baner location, close by Pune Bangalore highway. Has security check while entering the premises, you need a host permission to enter territory."
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,Clean and great location. New buildings are premium construction. Great schools nearby.

R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,Stayed for 2 years in D Building. Bad experience. People fought over Pets. Not recommended for Pet parents.
R102752,1 Year,24K Sereno,"Pros: - Good locality (area comes under smart city project) - Good safety features - Close to Pune - Bangalore highway - Mechanical parking (2 parking slots) - Good for investment Cons: - Poor construction plan / layout - Difficulty in parking car (especially SUV) - Plywood doors - Expensive - Use local brands for locks, home security system etc. - 35% loading factor - Kolte-Patil (well known builder) is not directly involved in this project. It's a marketing trick. - Society name is ""NOW Sereno"". Don't get traped by the name or brand (Marketing trick)."

R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,"Kalpataru Paramount in Thane is an impressive residential project that stands out for its strategic location and beautifully designed spaces. The apartments offer modern aesthetics and are complemented by a range of amenities that cater to all age groups, making it a vibrant yet serene place to live. The attention to detail in every aspect of construction and thoughtful layout planning by Kalpataru ensures that residents enjoy both comfort and luxury. An ideal choice for families looking for a harmonious blend of convenience and upscale living."
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,"Since 2018, we have been looking for a property that has all the parameters we thought off. This is our 3rd buy after selling 2. All of them were pretty good. What does it seem for all properties that they all have presales and post sales issue. Most of them have construction issues. Maintenance issues. Parking issues and resident issues. Overall, this property is quite better in terms of facilities & quality."
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,"Kalpataru Management Team has turned my first home buying experience to my worst nightmare. The only thing they are good at is looting their customers. They not only delayed the project beyond the deadline after Rera extension, but now the handover process support is more pathetic and time taking. They are greedy, immoral bunch of people who are unapologetic and behave like that they are doing a favor by giving my apartment to me after taking full payment from me even before I see my apartment. This happens when nexus between politicians, property tycoons and the powerful builder lobby ensure middle class can not take a break. Well, what a middle class can do, SUCK IT UP."
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,I have been living here for almost 2 years. Probably one of the worst designed complex. There are so many structural problems that I cannot list here.

Stack parking is not available - This is false and they are building one Feedback on after sales services: except collection of money, response time, quality of response and person handling scores 1(why even 1, sometimes they respond) You are at the hands of most unreliable chain of people Location - 9 Overall Quality - 7 Lift Quality - 5 (incidents of jerks, free fall reported) Washroom fittings - 5 Tiles and marbles - 7 Electric switches - 5 Water issues - 7 Cleaning of Parking area - 2 Cleaning of Floor - 5 Cleaning of common areas to attract customer - 7 Cleaning of lift - 5 Safety - 6 (attempt to house break from duct area between bathrooms, dog bite cases, dengue cases due to waterlogging on under construction cases) Parking Ramps are horrible Pls see few pictures for your reference."
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,"Visited this place with my family, good project with great location really loved the design. met manager called Aniket Chilap who I believe was the head of the project, thanking him with the knowledge and guidance he has provided us that has helped us to decide on location and project finalisation. Wish real estate projects have such knowledgeable and patient managers It was a great visit"
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,"FInally got possesion for my dream flat at Kalpataru Paramount. Thanks to everyone at Kalpataru: Service Support, Payments Support and Possession Team. Special Thanks to Sunil, Jitin, Manasi, Annu , Pankaj, Aditya, Santosh for working with so much of pressure and still managing to being polite and helping out us with all our queries."
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,"Quality of construction is too poor. Possession is being delayed. They will hurry with top slab and take 90-95% and then delay the possession by atleast 2 years. Committed fittings of Roca, sound/fire proof doors. The quality of sample flat and actual flat is very different. The fittings are not up to the mark."
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,"Pathetic management. Those who are planning to buy flat here please note following: 1. They have used all substandard electrical and plumbing equipments. 2. No complaint redressal system is in place as builder team has left it for society to deal with issues, which is yet to be formed. 3. Works are incomplete and for any issues there's a dedicated team sitting here to tell you that it's personal work and get it on your own."
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,"Did a site visit and saw 2 flats in a building they have handed over and has residents living in. And it does not look complete by any means, I.e. the completion standard is not to my expectations. Also the flats, even the 711 carpet 2BHKs are cramped. The site is right on the expressway, and the towers feel too close together. The kitchen was a good size though."
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,"Absoultely unprofessional builder. I have purchased flat in Tower 2, they have given possession after significant delay. Their CRM team is absoultely unapproachable when you want to know status of your flat, payment schedule etc.. They will call you only when they need installment from you. That time too, if you request for 1-2 days delay, they will ask you to pay to additional interest amount on delay. so absolutely unhuman. After purchase also they will not stop troubling you. When you ask for NOC for giving flat on rent, they will take minimum 2-3 months to give NOC. They will also not refund your security deposit even after 3 months of completion of interior work despite of repeated reminders. So, if you want enormous problems in your life before and after purchase of your dream home then Kalpataru Paramount is your one stop destination."
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,Anyone from Tower D? As per rera possession date should be June 2024 but still they have not given possession. They need to give rent starting June 2024 then.
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,"DO NOT INVEST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY IN THIS PATHETIC PIECE OF TRASH PROJECT , I booked a flat here in the year 2019 , still haven‚Äôt received the possession, even after complete payment of agreed amount i was demanded extra Interest rate which in it self was enormous , they have significantly delayed the project and are delaying possession of the flat even after the payment of interest amount , the crm team is full of goons , Its nearly been 2 months now that i have paid the (extorted interest ) and they still haven‚Äôt delivered my flat to me in the name of account clearing . Investing in this project has brought nothing but mental and financial pain to my family . We invested in this overly priced project thinking that kalpataru is an renowned builder but its all rubbish . Save your money and invest in better projects ."
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,"Kalpataru paramount is the worst project I have ever invested in. Already they have delayed possession by 3 years. And they have the audacity to charge interest even though there is no delay from my side when ideally they should pay all flat buyers as per MAHARERA rules for delayed possession. They even have the guts to charge maintenance before handing over possession and also charge some DG charges which were never a part of agreement and cost sheet. It seems they care two hoots for MAHARERA rules and regulations. And what to say about their customer service employees. They are absolute gems. They do not either understand what the customer is saying or just try to act dumb. They will never give any details of interest being charged, account statement etc. They will just keep asking for payment. And once all payments are done they will never reply to your calls or messages. Some names if these gem of employees are Allina, Annu etc. Please beware of them and their sweet talks. Overall, one of the most pathetic builders in Mumbai. God save all those who have invested in Kalpataru Paramount."
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,Third class sales team. I visited on site as suggested by their channel partners. I have been assigned with sales executives who did not know anything about the project apart from prices. Without explaining me anything about project he directly come to the pricing. Even he is not able to explain price break up. He called another person to answer my questions. It was kind of Lena hai to lo nahi to Jao attitude.
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,"Just to add to the detailed review by Mr Rajesh Agnihotri which is in quotes - ""My desire to buy an apartment was influenced by my coworkers who kept telling me of Kalpa Taru Paramount. I met with the professional and came to know it is yet to finish still I was given a detail of the place. Awesome detailed interiors, modern designs, amenities, Pool-side decks, lush landscapes, sports facilities, activity and games room, all-in-one clubhouse etc."" Hardly 40 to 50 metres away is a Gas station & a crematorium further away. A few furlong away are Shopping Malls, 24x7 gas filling station, there's a flyover right in front (North) which takes you to Mumbai, Pune & Nashik."
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,"I have no idea how are people providing reviews about construction quality since they have not allowed anyone to visit the actual construction site. Rera Date of Completion is 2024 Extended to 2025 now. It may be a good project in the future whenever it completes but I have seen the towers from a far ready for more than a year maybe even more than 2, but still no deliveries done."
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,One of the worst builder in Mumbai. They are scamming people just to sell their flats. They Commit on one thing and then keep on denying and postponing. Made a huge mistake by booking a flat here. The Support/CRM team is also the worst. They know nothing. Only false commitments. Would have given a 0 Rating if that was possible.
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,"Please don't buy under-construction flat from Kapataru. They will make you run for your money. Their sales team their CRM team is not at all professional, always do all false statements / commitments. You will lock all your hard earned money with them. They dont utter single word or provide no response even after many reminders when it came to delay in possession and paying customer their interest for delayed possession. They are very irresponsive Their brand value is equally hit due to allegations of financial irregularities."
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,"Please do not contact them by any mode...they will sell your number to all the property dealers and then the real nightmare of calls/messages will start. I am getting 30 calls daily from the day I visited their property, and that too for Godrej properties. Basically the people in their sales office are selling all your information for some kickbacks. Also I have checked the property, it is highly overpriced for 2 small sized rooms, not worth your time, and definitely not worth of the torture you will get by receiving 30+ calls every day"
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,"I am currently staying in kalpataru sunrise, Thane. I must say construction quality wise, housekeeping and maintainance wise Kalpataru is the best. We have visited many new projects/ resale but location of the paramount is the main attraction. One can easily avoid the traffic to reach this location. It has community stores, malls, schools, hospital, petrol pump, banks, Dmart, Big bazaar, bus stop, metro station, post office everything you need within radius of 1-3km. We didn't book here because was looking for ready to move property."
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,"One year extension given by RERA and still two Tower possessions not handover where they started 2017 now 2022. Almost 5 yrs is still a process , it's a question mark in the construction team..like government projects. Don't buy and refer to anyone still existing customers not handover possession."
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,"Good connectivity with Highway & Metro (expected to start by 2023). Construction is being done by Shapoorji Pallonji Group,have booked a flat 7 months back lets see how the project is executed as the project was launched in 2017 and its been a long wait who booked back then."
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,The best project so far in respect of connectivity in Thane location. Connects you to all main roads and metro as well. Construction quality is on par than other developers in vicinity.
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,"To all the flat owners of kalpataru paramount tower A & B common ameneties such as gym,pool, garden, jogg track play area wont be ready until 2024 but for possesion of flat in 2023 u would need to pay full maintainance amount which includes for all the above amenities which are not even near by ready So u have to pay upfront but u cannot use the amenities N this cost also wont be adjusted at alll N without paying u r not eligible for possesion So before getting too exited about possesion of ur respective flats be ready to donate ur maintainance cost"
R272675,>3 Years,Kalpataru Paramount,"Third grade developer, no assurance of quality, delay is a certainty, it is possible project may not be completed at all . Stay away from this developer better to donate money in charity"
R272675,1 Year,Kalpataru Paramount,Project is getting late by at least one year in the name of lockdown. However construction of other builders in nearby vicinity is full swing.

R316697,2 Years,Sagitarius Bluegrass Residences,"One of the best in class residential project !! Posh locality , lovely apartments , everything is latest and classy !! View from the flat !!"
R316697,2 Years,Sagitarius Bluegrass Residences,Visited the site of bluegrass residences 1 of the top most & best project in pune city with 1st class amenities and the most important thing is the internal flat specifications provided by the builder is very much good. Good residence project to buy with good connectivity
R316697,2 Years,Sagitarius Bluegrass Residences,"Don‚Äôt bother visiting. Salesperson has too much attitude. When asked to show sample flat refused to show saying sample flat is only for 4 bhk, no point in showing for 3 bhk requirement. You understand from what I am saying. No decency to even share a floor plan. Eventually it was a wasted visit for us."
R316697,2 Years,Sagitarius Bluegrass Residences,"This project is not trustworthy . This has lots of problems. In January,2022 - Six labours were dead at the site during construction time and project was on hold from Hon'ble Court. Now they are saying stay has been removed but still construction work is not resumed. After more inquiry , came to know the contractor Ahluwalia Company has been dismissed from project and Dr. Wadia is looking for new contractor, which will further delay the possession of project."
R316697,2 Years,Sagitarius Bluegrass Residences,"An upcoming 3 & 4 bhk residential apartment complex in West Avenue, Kalyani Nagar. In its, phase 1 the developers have planned 3 towers with approx 24 floors. It is set to have a swimming pool, gym, small park, clubhouse, and a recreational area. It does seem like a promising project."
R316697,2 Years,Sagitarius Bluegrass Residences,High level residential project in the heart of city and famous Kalyani Nagar area
R316697,2 Years,Sagitarius Bluegrass Residences,Yesterday was my first visit to Blue Grass Residences project. I came out after selecting a flat of my choice for my son on 11th floor that is going to witness sunrise in the morning and sunset in the evening. Prime location. Beautiful ambiance. Overviewing Mula Mutha river and Pune Metro track. Full of modern amenities. Could not find any missing facility. Simple love it.

R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,"If you are planning to buy a new flat here...this is the time not to go...from the day 1 since I met their sales team...they trying to push the flats by giving you wrong information... their ground sales team is so rude and don't have basic knowledge of the project... every time I ask some question, they were trying to bluff around...and providing the wrong information which I validated from the residents who are already living there......once i cancelled my booking their team started behaving rude and raised their voice when I visited their office asking for the refund...the sales team started mentioning that come on some weekdays we cannot do it on weekend ....but while taking money from your pocket... their whole team is available on any of the day..... It took me 5 months to recover my booking amount... So, please take a proper check before booking the flat in highland springs... and this is the genuine feedback Im giving.."
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,Till date project is not completed with basic amenities. Flat owners suffering from lots of issues.Pathetic builder. Never book any flat in thier project if you dont want to waste your money. Always keep extending dates.
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,It is a very good society and has budget friendly rooms. There are plenty Nearby shops which are helpful for the society.
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,"Parking issue is there, but society is good."
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,"Excellent location, parking no issues, 80 feet wide road on two sides, just 2 min drive (>500 meters) to flyover towards Pune & Nashik. Similarly metro station (will be ready soon), Goenka International School, some of the best Hospitals, Shopping Malls, numerous mid to high end restaurants & Mumbai University - Thane Campus & Narayana School are 1 minute stroll away. On the opposite side ie West are the high-end towers by MHADA .. video shoot is facing East."
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,One of well established housing society to live in.
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,"Please don't book flats in highland spring. There are lots of issue such as irregularities of water, electricity, leakage everywhere, no cleanliness. Its like staying in chawl. Better to invest little more money in another project. Atleast you will live better life there. And all the 5 star ratings are paid ratings. So don't get fooled by this stupid builder"
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,"Worst Architect, worst builder of Thane. Leakage issue everywhere. False commitment still amenities not provided. Worst experience ever"
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,Nice place it is an amazing community place. My friend stays here. So whenever I went to Mumbai i never fail to visit this place. The concept was very good. The parking place place is well arranged and the park is in the second floor of the parking lot. Swimming pool is also there in the second floor. Presently the new system is installed at every block so that no body can enter the premises without proper validation of the owners.
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,This is one more project in the Thane area with many other.There is no good reason to buy the property like this builders.Even RERA also can't help you to get possession ontime if you have paid your down payment.
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,"Very bad experience. At a time of booking they said possession will be in Jun 2020 max it can go to Nov 2020. After that they told us because of covid-19, construction impacted and so the possession will be in March 2021. Again possession moved to Dec 2021. MahaRera date given is June 2022. After that developer proposed date Dec 2022 and Now they are saying the possession will be in Mar 2023. Even after that it doesn't look like possession will be given in Mar 2023. Each time I contacted sales person they are just extending the possession and giving another date. They are just making us fool. My suggestion is you should tell the exact possession date to the flat buyers, as we are investing our money in this project for early possession. Office staff is not professional. Developer is not professional. Not at all happy with buying house at highland. Worst customer service."
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,KEEP AWAY FROM THIS PROJECT IF YOU ARE THINKING OF BUYING NEW HOUSE!!! I paid token amount for a flat in Highland spring. Sales team told me that within 1st week of December 2022 they will have flat registration. But its 3 months since then and no help from them. They keep giving future dates and false promises. They are unprofessional and won't care about your time.
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,Very unprofessional and mannerless staff as I mentioned. they don't have any talking sense when someone goes to enquire about the project. They were so rude when we went to inquire about the project specially sales team.i think labour class people also have some class and better sense to talk to someone but this staff is worse than them..GOD BLESS the builder i think half of his clients must be cancelling the deal bcz of his rude n unprofessional staff. They don't deserve one star also. It was better when Mr. Manish and Mr.Bhavesh used to handle the project..
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,Pathetic builder. Never book any flat in thier project if you dont want to waste your money. Very unprofessional staff. Always keep extending dates.
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,We had booked our flat in February 2017 when it was first launched..and we were informed possession is in 2020 june. and later in RERA it was mentioned June 2022 but we were told again possession will be max by Dec 2020 and now entire 2020 and 2021 no correct updates. Today I see on RERA website the possession is june 2023. this is pathetic. buildings commenced construction post 2018 have also delivered..And here we are not even receiving correct updates.
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,Project was good but covid has impacted. Poor response from builder office. Project is delayed. And time commitment is not given being a reputed builder the comunication should be prompt. Email was sent to siddi group no one responded. My suggestions is to builder is he should give time to people investing in project. Sales person says builder doesn't meet anyone. How unprofessional this could be.
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,We booked a 2 BHK in 2018 and in the last few months we have been trying to reach out to the Builders but not getting any response. The RERA website says there seems to be some litigations on this project ? This is extremely worrisome
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,"Project review: Overall Bad experience, False commitments, Property delays alot, poor Construction quality and poor communication as they wont reply you on e-mail once you give them token, and many other ISSUES with this property."
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,Hopeless Developer of Thane...Project delayed by 4 yrs ... no compensation to owners.. quality of work inferior . pathetic exp .. not recommended
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,"Grocery ,vegetables, fruit, sweet /namkeen stores, medical stores, hardware stores, Xerox /Stationery,... Its a nice place...meets most needs around our residential area..Runwal Garden city. What is lacking is a ATM machine...nothing close by...."
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,About 72% work is completed for B Wing & that too on hold since Mar 20 & after covid they haven't constructed anything or else we could have received disbursement mail from the builder but it's sad the way they are doing construction work!
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,"Worst sales team, they are just making fool to the flat buyers. They told buyers that project will complete in next 6 month.. but from Last 2-3 years there's in no progress in construction"
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,At dhokali we booked and apartment and given lac as token amount after knowing fake promises about loan etc we decided to cancelled our booking They promised to give our money back but he is delaying his commitment since two months and yesterday he said it will take six months We are going to complaint against Think twice before getting your house of dreams from here
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,"I booked flat in 2016... Still work is not complete ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è.. in aggrimment they mention date June 2020.. and while booking they said .. will get flat possation on before Dec 2019.... They lie.. feeling very bad,.."
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,I had a nice experience....the work was really very awesome.......very beautifully stitched the dress...would suggest you all to visit her once
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,Location of this project is nice but the flats are compact size and prices are very expensive compared to market
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,"Astounding project with all the amenities, and a bigger carpet 1 bhk with an affordable pricing."
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,"Pathetic experience, delaying delivery dates by almost 1 year now."
R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,Nice Appartment with Excelent Playground and parking with ClubHouse...

R266443,2 Years,Siddhi Highland Springs,"Currently living at Highland Springs, Dhokali. The buildings and amenities are still under construction, which causes a lot of dust and regular disturbance. Water shortage is a frequent issue, which affects daily living. On the positive side, the rooms are clean and well-maintained, and the security is reliable. However, due to ongoing construction and basic utility issues, the overall living experience right now is below expectations. Hoping for improvement once the project is fully completed."

R13494,2 Years,Dynamix Parkwoods,"I had a very disappointing experience with this builder, particularly with the sales team and CRM team. At the time of purchase they told us the possession date will be March 2025. Now Ms.Babita Sharma from the sales team states that we will provide possession on Dec 25. However, when we reached out to the CRM team for confirmation, they had no clue about the possession timeline or any project details. They only provide false hopes and information. Feels like cheated. I can see the D5 tower from the past year, but no significant changes happened from possession point of view. A lot of internal work pending and the builder had shifted his focus to D6 tower work for the sake of booking amount from new customers. So he can loot money from new customers as well. Be cautious when you are booking a flat with this builder, especially Tower D6."
R13494,2 Years,Dynamix Parkwoods,A Beautiful Project. The sales persons are too good. Kalyani and Nandini have been helpful and always answered our queries. A good project always needs such staff. A very Good team. God bless you all.
R13494,2 Years,Dynamix Parkwoods,"No Proper communication by sales team about the possesion date, also unable to view the actual flat yet even if the tower is ready since last one year, delayed possesion. CRM Team will only contact you when demand is raised and chase actively, then they purposely ignore your queries and questions. Quality of fittings were promised is much diffrent and low quality in actual flats. Will not go with this builder ever again. Disappointed Buyer !"
R13494,2 Years,Dynamix Parkwoods,"The CRM team, especially Ms. Vijaya, has been extremely unresponsive. Calls and queries regarding project status and possession details are ignored, and there is no clear communication. The only time they reach out is when a disbursement is required. Highly disappointed with the lack of transparency and support."
R13494,2 Years,Dynamix Parkwoods,"The possession has been delayed and there has been no communication from the CRM team regarding this matter. Worst CRM team, sales team and their management. I did not get your message, however i will not delete /edit my comment as this is very much appropriate and it is due to delay in the possession and no work in progress"
R13494,2 Years,Dynamix Parkwoods,Pathetic CRM team. No proper communication on possession . We have booked the flat in 2021 with a commitment of possession in 2023. And today I‚Äôm writing this review in 2025 with zero clarity of possession still . No reply from management as well All emails being unanswered Quality of fittings are compromised and doesn‚Äôt at all match to the show flat I wudnt recommend this builder to anyone . Extremely disappointed!
R13494,2 Years,Dynamix Parkwoods,The builder and their sales team are only concerned about the sales and least bothered about the completion of project. Don't fall for any commitment from their management and sales team.whenever they are being asked about the completion date everytime 6 months is added to their commitment. Worst experience to deal with.
R13494,2 Years,Dynamix Parkwoods,"One of the Prime Luxurious project on Ghodbunder Road. Just step away from upcoming Metro station and Dmart. All schools, hospitals nearby and many new things coming near by area. For Parkwood -excellent team. The Staff and Sales team is very co-operative. Mr Shiv is excellent in communication and let you explore all the project. Overall great experience."
R13494,2 Years,Dynamix Parkwoods,Worst CRM team... No communication regarding reasons for delay in the project . CRM team has a standard answer ' We will get back to soon' but don't know when. Please do not recommend this project to one one...
R13494,2 Years,Dynamix Parkwoods,"Pathetic builder, our project is delayed for over a year and nobody is bothered to give any clarity on the possession date. We are repenting after investing our money in this project."
R13494,2 Years,Dynamix Parkwoods,"Worst CRM team, salespeople who sold this project have left the company and now promises made by them are now being denied by CRM team. They will simply say that go and check RERA. The possession date has been delayed and there has been no communication from the CRM team regarding this matter. To make matters worse, they are not even willing to provide a new confirm possession date. Even their management is not taking responsibility for the promises made by the sales team. I would strongly advise other buyers to ensure they get everything in writing before proceeding with registration if they are considering purchasing a flat from Dynamix."

R371041,2 Years,Casagrand Millenia,The project was to be completed by Dec last year and CG says that it is ready for occupancy. I think the photos (taken July 2024) speak for themselves. And this is the state of CG's ultra luxurious Millenia project.

R371041,2 Years,Casagrand Millenia,"We are deeply disappointed to share that Casagrand Millenia Chennai has failed to honor their commitment. Despite collecting 95% of the payment 12 to 14 months ago, the project remains incomplete and unsafe. Promises were made both verbally and via email that the project would be handed over 18 months ago. The situation has caused significant mental and financial distress to us and other homeowners. While Casagrand continues to launch new projects, they have neglected their responsibility to complete and properly hand over existing ones. We urge the community to stand with us and demand accountability."

This is small DDA sfs society in comparison with others. This is small but beutiful well managed society as per my view as a regular visitor from last 2 years here. From security (checks & registration),well maintained roads,cleanliness,CCTV camera installed throughout,good/adequate lightening,beutiful plantation & special feature being the 3 by 2 feet size pictures of animals pasted all the way at society's road. The management appears good. The society is having 3 floor building only & no elevator/lifts installed.This feature actually is not good for ailing person or any elderly person having health issues specially if they reside at 2nd or 3rd floor.Parking space appears to be adequate. Overall, a good society."

R178815,1 Year,Royal Orchid,"The builder has built quite a few medium size gated communities in Ameenpur area. This project is one of their premium segment projects and biggest in terms of no. of units.

So the future reputation of builder as an upcoming star in Hyd Real Estate depends very much on this project. The top management is consciously putting special attention in terms of quality of construction, material used, Finishing, using reputed brand tiling, electricals, plumbing etc. Royal Orchids is going to be their display showpiece for all future projects, so they are leaving no stone unturned to give the best to the buyers.

The area is strategic. Current price of 6k psft is the best in the market. Blindly go for it!

R1153,1 Year,Siddha Pines,"Being here for more than a year, and I'm really disappointed with the service. We booked the community hall for our private party and the staff members didn't disclose half of the information, we had to end up paying more at the end than the usual amount which they never informed us about it. The ACs were not on chill mode and were all on 24, broken chairs and tables, the security kept coming to bother us over and over, this was really a bad experience"
R1153,1 Year,Siddha Pines,"A really grt appartment or housing society build by Siddha. They are now perhaps the best builder in and around Kolkata.

This Siddha Pines is located just opposite of Dirozio College , Rajarhaat road.

My frnd leaves in A110, and I am visiting this place from the time he owned his 3 BHK 1st flr Flat

This society has all the modern amenities, power back-up, lift, well maintenance.

Recently they have rebuild their entire security system with ultra modern automatic gate and their app which ensures the safety of the flat owners.

One issue I must report in this honest review they have a problem with Guest Car parking, even the owners are facing some kind of stringency with the parking system here.

The underground parking system is good with more than enough headroom and modern anti fire system.

I just love the concept of their, Gym, swiming pool, children's club and also a good specious banquet hall ( available with cost).

Overall a very nice place to leave."
R1153,1 Year,Siddha Pines,It's a good residential complex at Rajerhat Kolkata. It's actually 2.1km from Chinner park and one more road from City center 2. Bait far from.

Interesting is that one year before, 3bhk lauching price was 60 lacs and now asking 92 lac. How come ? Is that Sustainable growth, raising many concerns? Major concern with sales Manager's rude behaviour who believes themselves as owner of Adani. They don't know how to communicate with customers or may be they are least bother. I come across sales manager Prashant Avalani and Mehul Dhandhukiya who send me offer and later no response at all for negotiation. He would have responded with 'sorry, no negotiation' but no response at all. It raises many questions for their behaviour, specially once any buyer seal the deal. I am happy that I avoided Amogha."

R271771,1 Year,Casagrand Crescendo,"Just wanted to thank Casagrand for helping us in the process of purchasing a property. They were involved from educating about the property till the completion of registration process. We had limited time to view the property which they understood completely and showed us only the right type of plans. They made the whole process transparent that is key to success. They expedited the process by swiftly interacting with the banker to collect the required documents during the loan process. Sale and CRM are honest, resourceful and prompt in their approach. Thanks a lot to both of them for making this happen and I would strongly recommend this place to anyone. Cheers üëçüèº"

R271771,1 Year,Casagrand Crescendo,"Unauthentic and irresponsible I booked a flat in casagrand crescendo in Feb 2020 trusting that it is a genuine and reputed builder. But what I am experiencing now is not so. When I booked the flat they told me that interior work will be done free of cost( which is mentioned in document also), if I book the flat immediately. So I booked the flat immediately trusting them. But 2 months before they told me that the interior work offer amount will be adjusted in the final payment. Even after I agreed with them they have still not informed me anything. Whenever I call the customer relationship executive and ask them about it they are saying it is in process very casually. Moreover they have fixed late payment fees during covid lockdown period. Regarding the completion of the apartment still EB connection has not been done and the apartment is running with genset connection"

R271771,1 Year,Casagrand Crescendo,Place and location is good. Nice customer experience until you start discussing about pricing. Ad says 5200 they say 5400 as if we are uneducated fools. When asked what would be best price to offer they are asking 1 lakh token amount.. Without knowing what it would cost me how can I book an apartment..I am just choosing KG because I am clear about pricing before booking it.. To be frank you lost a prospect buyer due to this attitude....

CRM Mahalakshmi not answering properly and she also had a lack of customer support. Handing over team Mookambika and Sadiq not responding to pick up any calls.

R271771,1 Year,Casagrand Crescendo,"Worst customer support team. No professional people. I booked an unit and paid 45prcnt already but for further loan purpose they didnt give necessary documents on time because of which my banking process got delayed. Now CRM threatens that will release the unit if we don't give sanction letter. Also comments that may be my loan didnt go through as I maynot have proper cibil, income or profile. Very disrespectful. When requested to meet top officials she is not allowing us to meet anyone. Crm said even if you meet official again you will come to us...how rude... I own 4 flats which I purchased from other builders but this one is my bad try. Feel very insulted. We couldnot move out also as our money is blocked with them. Please be careful when you buy. Because of few employees entire reputation is damaged"
R271771,1 Year,Casagrand Crescendo,I am planning to buy a flat in Cresendo Everything is good but there are two types of staircase attached with every corridor one is closed that gives safe feel but open staircase looks unsafe for children because height of walls of stairs is very less and there are no grills also .So i think that is what pulling me back . I seriously want that someone from company make me understand that why this is so less heighted

Its was surrounded by Decathlon , Mgr University, sri Chaitanya school , Goodwill hospital and Ambattur industrial estate. Its situated close to highway - easy acces to road - its one of the best plus point to choose this project.

R338375,1 Year,Silver Gracia,"What we wanted we got It so happened that driving by the Ravet chowk , we ( my brother and me ) saw a large poster/ banner /advertisement displaying READY POSSESSION.. SILVER GRACIA at the London bridge intersection‚Ä¶and immediately located the site by way of the google map and approached the sales office. Here met with Mr. Sachin Chopedkar, senior sales executive‚Ä¶.who explained the project very minutely and highlighted the special features/amenities of the entire project & also availability of units..and more importantly, availailability of ready to move in 2Bhk units in Silver Gracia - phase 2. The sales rep. Shri Sachin chopade was extremely polite and informative and patient with us because we posed a lot of questions to which he replied well to our satisfaction ‚Ä¶inspite of the odd hours of our visit.. he still entertained us as also a lady assistant miss Varsha..who showed us the vacant flat on the 13th floor .. and another opp flat explaining as we put questions to her..There after we went into a discussion with Mr. Sachin Chopdekar ..llwho patiently discussed all the payment particulars to the T. Satisfied‚Ä¶we graciously and spontaneously decided to go for this project and agreed to the terms of payment.. to make payment of the booking amount to be paid the next day.. It was magic .. Almost instantly we (my brother and my self ) felt this was the project we could rely on and satisfied we decided to see the project once again with family the next day .. which was satisfactorily finalised the next day. Happy to be associated with all team members , starting with Shri sachin miss Varsha , Mr Suraj and Mr . Gopal Bandi , who always willing assisted me during the subsequent days for all the queries regarding the payment till the time of registration .The on site engineer Shri Gaurang Patil I/c of C-Block was very prompt in handing over the flat after adhering to the check list prepared and getting everything that I requested for immediately done.. I was there fore able to take possession on 31/12/2024 at the stroke of 2025..Thanks to Engineer Gaurang Patil.

R338375,1 Year,Silver Gracia,Property is good. The kitchen is small though and the granite is only on one side. Balconies are good and the room sizes are fair. The dining + hall is somewhat small too. The sales associate (Mr. Sachin) was pathetic and very rude. Not sure how he got appointed with such terrible people skills.
R338375,1 Year,Silver Gracia,"1. Flats are very small. A 774 carpet area 2 BHK dosent look like the area defined. Do measure before buying. 2. Price of same is very high compare to other projects in Ravet. 3. The sales team will make you feel that they are doing an obligation by selling a flat to you. 4. The construction quality is actually at par, not at all excellant when we are paying 85 lakhs for 2 BHK small flat. Overall all the project not worth at the price they are selling"

And he was keep on busy on mobile chat. after some time he played video on his laptop for amenity and left the cabin, This kind of such behavior is irritable. We were there to invest huge amount and buy a home for us...not to do timepass... if You guys are hiring this kind of sales manager then i want to tell you clearly that no one will buy your property. Because end of the day if someone is purchasing home and investing money then one will need some attention. Please give some training to your sales persons..."

R261050,1 Year,DDA Residential Flats,"A filthy place. 2 Big MCD bins at the rear side entrance not cleared for weeks. Smell and garbage spread everywhere. Security sleeps, dogs chase you, big nallah gives unbearable stench with swarms mosquitoes, insects and even snakes. Inside the drains are chocked, broken drain covers not replaced for years. Lots of noise by central school. Ineffective, for Name sake RWA. Pathetic living conditions with chronic parking issues due to outsiders cars without any questions."

The next door neighbours dog pounces anytime. So, beware! They have regular celebration of Independence Day and Republic Day. They host Diwali Mela each year. They have RWA office and a separate community Hall. I prefer to avoid. They every order to pay undue amount and overcharge several services. They don't support or help. They had demanded whatsApp group but don't support any stating they are not owned by RWA. They ruined my reputation stating I am a spammer.

R261050,1 Year,DDA Residential Flats,"It comes under RWA. It is a residential area ranging from 2-3 BHK in very good conditions. Area wise the rooms are very big and proper sunlight facing (most of the flats). So the entrances in these societies are not accessible to everyone unless you have some work inside the premise. Also, the guards are very responsive in this matter. The Flats in this Pocket are in good condition there is a Central Park at the centre of the pocket, where most of the activities take place and a big ground is there for other games and activities. But I noticed the cleanliness of the pocket is not up to the mark."

The block has one temple inside the block and flats are available in multiple sizes. During the night time or you can say after 10 pm, only one gate is open and rest of the gates are closed due to security reasons. The block has some mid sized park inside the boundary wall.

R223215,2 Years,DDA Shanti Kunj Apartments,"Roads are very bad in the complex ,some spots are dark"
R223215,2 Years,DDA Shanti Kunj Apartments,"It is well ventilated and we'll kit place with greenery and trees around the garden. There is play area for kids and an open gym in park. Maintenance of these areas is low. There a temple with daily prayers of aarti. There is a two storey community hall. A dedicated RWA office. Guard room at each gate. The gates are barricaded. Facilities are poor. There is household interference by neighbours. There is pump house with central alarm for water supply alert. Delivery of letters is confused, sometimes in letter box sometimes at home and sometimes unreached! Basic facilities of grocery and daily need items are available but qeality is average. I don't like my neighbourhood. There are two pet owned flats in a block of 8 floors. The stray dogs are also tamed into the staircase. Servant facility is there but not reliable. Dhobi/ washerman/ laundry is overcharged with folding of clothes without iron. It needs to be done else where. They even ruin the crease of clothes. They make undue demands and sometimes overcharge. The Rickshaw fares are inconsistent and sometimes an obligation of circumstances that you avail the service. There was effect of circumstances with significant impact on the society. Parking is an everyday nuisance. Despite ear marked parking, it has been made an open parking with frequent quarrels. The entry of vehicle is basis sticker, yet it applies to only some and not all. The RWA interferes with visitors and sources household information. They use the residents as volunteers and deprive them there due payments. There is also spread of rumors within the community, stalking and following. The gardens are averagely maintained with stray animals and bee-hives which are removed or allayed time to time. There is drinking water provision for the visitors at the gates. The visitor approval is by No broker App which is frequently hacked. Overall it's a good place to be if you are happy in your home. I don't have friends living here since 2002. However, people I know have been cordial. A hello is always welcome but you wonder is it leads to estrangement and lies ü•∫üíßüòÖüôÉüòê"
R223215,2 Years,DDA Shanti Kunj Apartments,"Residential flats developed by DDA, Nearest metro station is Dwarka sector 9, in terms of facilities their is 2 small parks with kid zone inside the Apartment complex. Numbing of Flats is little bit confusing, there is 2 gates for the society. From security point of view it's good. There is small temple inside the apartments."

R178437,2 Years,RWA Sarvodaya Enclave,This Place is not actually at Malviyanagar. It's situated on the road connecting both the Sarvodaya Enclave and Adhcini Village. It's only a small place where you can use the ATMs and A Bar and Two Cafes (both sides of the road) along with a unisex salon. You can find a Vodafone mini store there and Reliance JIO at the opposite of the road. Few Motor Bicycle shops with Servicing facilities @ opposite side of the road. This place does have parking issue. Two Bicycle Shops are there but they don't do any punctures if incase you get punctured. A sweet shop is there which is not worthy buying anything from them. A Biryani Fast Food Shop as a fast food facility. You may find some shops having local brands nothing special. People are not friendly there as far as I am concerned.

R9902,2 Years,Ratan Prestige,Very good society to live with family. Good security system. Society members are very kind and cooprative. Very calm area.
R9902,2 Years,Ratan Prestige,"My friend stays here, so I am a frequent visitor to this place. Typical mediocre society, nothing out of the world."
R9902,2 Years,Ratan Prestige,It's an elite residential society that comes with all necessary amenities along with the close proximity to the renouned places.
R9902,1 Year,Ratan Prestige,Outside area of the society isn't very pleasant however inside it is very nice.
R9902,1 Year,Ratan Prestige,Location is little interior but rest is good
R9902,1 Year,Ratan Prestige,"Good, secured, easy access."
R9902,1 Year,Ratan Prestige,Good society at kharadi.
R9902,1 Year,Ratan Prestige,Very nice society
R9902,1 Year,Ratan Prestige,"Nice place and friendly environment to live.. easy access to kharadi by pass and Nagar road .. if you have own vehicle easy to connect different areas like Kalayani Nagar , Viman Nagar etc .. from society by using short cuts.. there are pros and cons for every society but I would say and feel second home to live.."
R9902,1 Year,Ratan Prestige,"Very well maintained society. With gym, function hall and kids play garden. Society has been run by very well dedicated persons which you can see by cleanliness inside the premises as well as prompt security at the entrance."
R9902,1 Year,Ratan Prestige,"A housing society located in the heart of Kharadi area. Location is well suited as it is in a walking distance to the nearest bus station which is Kharadi bypass. Nearby landmark is the Reliance mart. Also taking a one minute walk, one can find a peaceful local market place for grocery and daily needs. The place is well maintained with a functioning gym, children's park, a sufficient parking lot, security staff, society activity area and openly located benches to rest at different places throughout the open space. Spread majorly in 3 buildings with two lifts each, keeping in mind that each building has 4 flats per floor. The size of the lifts is a thing to worry since they can take a maximum of 5 person. One can order food at anytime but again due to soobe society rules you might have to go to the main gate and receive your order, which is a little thing to worry. Overall the society is more centered towards growing a family environment. So if you are thinking of acquiring a flat here, keep these things in mind."
R9902,1 Year,Ratan Prestige,"Good environment to live, connected by 3 different roads, just opp to bollywood theatre and reliance smart, DP road is going to implement very soon. Spacious and very nice layout of flats"

R68514,1 Year,9 Avenues,"The society is absolute pleasure. It has all the amenities, from swimming pool to a nicely decorated garden. The apartments are built in a pleasant way too, with the windows facing the east, and multiple balconies. The only thing I did not like was the location. The area around is under construction, and there are long dug roads, and the view also has buildings under construction."

R368780,1 Year,Vrindavan Garden,"There is issue with roads entry for local societies : Vrindavan Garden, Om Garden, Krishna Villa, GR Garden, and all other connected societies, it is only 10 feet or even lesser somewhere.."
R368780,1 Year,Vrindavan Garden,"For middle class people who can live there just to save rent and build a good property for future, but if a number of working persons are more in your family, it's better to go for other options"
R368780,1 Year,Vrindavan Garden,New development site... Road is good bathroom is too small
R368780,1 Year,Vrindavan Garden,"Gud place to residing, low cost budget villa and duplex. Gated society with road connectivity. 30 ft main road with pole lighting. More than 100 family is already shifted and more are going on. Still inventory are available for corner plots. All sizes available..."
R368780,1 Year,Vrindavan Garden,Very good location and construction. Builder is too much honest and reliable. He is running nearly two dozens project and all of them running successfully. This project is famous as GR Garden . His two other projects GR Garden 2 and 1 are nearby and successfully completed. Builder is famous for good construction and panctual in delivery time. Price is also reasonable. Builders every projects are peaceful area and less pollution. I am also a resident of his nearby project and recommend his all projects without any hesitation.
R368780,1 Year,Vrindavan Garden,"This locality is not good for leaving, you can purchase a property in cheap rates but there's no amenities for children or adult.. Most of the land is occupied by people who belongs from Bihar, Bangal. But the good part is that they all are from IT background."
R368780,1 Year,Vrindavan Garden,Construction is good but there is no car parking for 2BHK homes. Road connectivity is poor but maybe in future there will be good connectivity as per builders.
R368780,1 Year,Vrindavan Garden,Sach a bad experience here there is electricity cut all the time there is nobody who can take action against them
R368780,1 Year,Vrindavan Garden,"There is issue with main entry road for local colonies(Vrindavan garden, Om Garden, Khatu shyam, GR Garden, etc.) Only 10ft road for more than 4 colonies. Please think before planning to buy."

R368780,1 Year,Vrindavan Garden,"It is in jungle. Society is large. But road connectivity is poor. To reach society, you have to cross jungles. That does not feel safe. All the land is free hold, no nationalised bank gives loan. Society is establishing. Some families have started living. Pros: Peaceful area Cons: No rods, no public transport Poor road connectivity Due to free hold property, no bank is giving loan. It is not GDA approved. Jungle area No market or shop in society. No gates, no gaurd Poor construction Property rate is high as compared to development 42k/yard"
R368780,1 Year,Vrindavan Garden,Society is moderate but entry road is very very narrow. the material used in House are poor quality.the builder promises but doesn't do

R368780,1 Year,Vrindavan Garden,Location Are miner good but future will very good ... According to development
R368780,1 Year,Vrindavan Garden,"You are requested not to fall in the trap of this builder or else all the money will be wasted, dishonest, thieves are builders, don't waste your money or time."
R368780,1 Year,Vrindavan Garden,"Incompetent area, unkind residents, horrible place to live in, residents are dangerous a mob actually gathered. Bad Experience with Satyam."

R381087,1 Year,Prestige City Avalon Park,Avalon Park is ready for handover this month as per RERA guidelines. Prestige is awaiting permanent electricity and Occupancy Certificate (OC) as of last week.
R381087,1 Year,Prestige City Avalon Park,This is one of the biggest project by Prestige Construction. Avalon park interiors and apartment designs are fantastic.
R381087,1 Year,Prestige City Avalon Park,Owners note that Prestige will not be providing kitchen counter top. You will have to buy and get it done with your modular kitchen design. Also the Avalon park will not have piped gas connection. There is no set up done for this in the completed project. So you will have to get gas cylinders by yourself.
R381087,1 Year,Prestige City Avalon Park,"Prestige avalon park is in the construction phase. As visited in april 2023 few villas were fully constructed and just waited to get the finishing. The rest of the city has only a few towers being constructed and that too looked like it was at a slow speed. For such a big city they should have had a higher force to construct the city at greater pace.
All and all if completed fully it will be like a city in itself with such a huge area and everything inside the gates."
R381087,1 Year,Prestige City Avalon Park,"Faced very bad attitude üò† and behavior from the sales executive there. He was least bothered about our questions, had no idea of the available units...he wasn't interested in speaking to us and entire time showed attitude.Didn't even waited for us and just went directly to other room,post discussion."
R381087,1 Year,Prestige City Avalon Park,"Mismanagement in handling customers. They are having lots of customers, sometimes wait for 2 hours to get a prestige employee speak to you. Marketing is outsourced to third party. Lots of attitude prestige employees show in sales site. In call they will tell available within price, but after reaching story is different."
R381087,1 Year,Prestige City Avalon Park,"There are telegram groups for owners. Some of them are fake public groups(beware!) but you can reach through them to the right group if you already don't know someone who is part of the right group. If you are one of the owner then consider joining them.

Irony is that despite no external amenities and it being very congested, it's sold out project due to Prestige brand."
R381087,1 Year,Prestige City Avalon Park,The location is awesome and with all facilities provided inside the society is everything u need
R381087,1 Year,Prestige City Avalon Park," But its Rural Bangalore under BMRDA.
- Under BDA and BMRDA no norms like Gated community, its road will be public road once project complete by year 2026.
- Anyway thanks to buyer here to help Prestige to build road connecting East gate (Sarjapur Road) and west gate (Ittanguru Road)
- same 3BHK price new buyer can get Villa within 2 to 4 km circle here."
R381087,1 Year,Prestige City Avalon Park,"Avalon towers are very well positioned opposite the villas, next to the upcoming Prestige mall in the Prestige city project."

R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,"Many reasons to not go for this apartment, main reason is water logging outside community and you won't be able to go out in rainy sessions. Every year you need to spend lot of money to repair car and bike. Minimum of 1 to 1.5 feet water logging will be there. Refer video and pics."
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,"Nice apartments!
Totally about 700+ apartment houses are available in this gated community....
Club House facilities are available...
Neatly maintained...
Very spacious common area...
Lawn is also maintained well...
Children's play area available as well... Located in Thazhambur..."
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,Not a good place to stay in rent or buy. Water gets logged like a pond in front of the entrance and stagnant even after a week
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,Very worst place. Dont choose this community for living. Just for one day moderate rain the entrance is completely logged with water for more than 10 days. The water level keeps increasing and unable to commute . You can‚Äôt go out with car or bike. The association is not responsive at all and there is no communication group available. The telegram channel only lets the admins to post but we can‚Äôt ask or discuss anything. The park inside the community also gets water stagnant for small rains also and they never clean it . It has to only sundry. So most days you can‚Äôt use the park. The club house maintanence is worst. No washrooms are operational. The kids play area is just one room. Swimming pool is soo foul smell. I don‚Äôt know why they get 3000+ maintanence every month for this type of non maintanence. There are around 700 houses in the community and every month they get 21Laks but none of that is being used properly. Many house owners have rented the property and tenants are not given proper response by association for basic things too.
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,"Even for small rain entrance is flooded with water. This image is taken after 4 days of rain stopped.
you can't commute outside, car and bike not able to commute. If you are searching for rental or buying a property. Avoid this society, no proper association. You will pay huge maintenance, i can't get resolution for water logging for last 3 years."
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,"Appartament with all the facilities‚Ä¶. Good place to stay in OMR.. swimming pool, gym, playstation, outdoor and indoor games"
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,"We had a worst experience with this builder and community. They will call you repeatedly until you purchase an unit and once you do, they actually abscond. They don‚Äôt pick calls and dodge the responsibilities to multiple teams who won‚Äôt even answer your calls. You have to start begging them from then on for each and every work that you want to be completed at your house. I wouldn‚Äôt give a single star for this builder. No quality in the construction. We had to keep a person ready for patchwork whenever we had to hang anything on the wall. We made a blunder buying this property."
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,"Long post alert . Read if it matters to you

Easily the worst construction from Casagrand , with day by day declining of the construction quality from Casagrand this Apartment peaks it all .
Walls to Pillars , Electricals to Plumbing all of them are inferior quality . Walls cant hold TV or AC unit , if drilled the walls just give away like cake and not strong enough to hold even TVs and AC units . Imagine the built quality . There is water stagnation all around the Apartment and the roads leading to it , Cars have to sail to reach the apartment , During monsoon season Mosquitos will swarm all around with bonus of Snakes too .

Apartment association has an ongoing case against CG for multiple reasons , Generator failures , STP and WTP failures etc

Apart from all this , those who own the Flats here are so biased towards tenants , its different rule for flat owners and different rule for Tenants , how can that be ? Owners want the money from Tenants but then they are not treated same . Such a terrible community with very low morale .

Maintenance cost is sky high like a premium Society .
Association is struggling with multiple groups trying to Corrupt and scam the resident fund .

Frequent failures of STP , WTP and Power backups . will make ur day today living like hell
Easily the worst community to reside . Glad I vacated .

if u are looking to rent or buy a Flat here , do a detailed research and then proceed

Avoid at any cost"
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,"Experience regarding Casagrand Supremus as one of the owner.
Kavitha from Block12, staying here for past 19 months. Facing lot of problems here and list is below.
1) Fitting for bathroom tiles are not proper and they are broken.
2) Master bedroom lock is not working
3) Unusual cracks in main entrance. Patch work is done, but not completed.
Raised complaint lot of times to Icare but not getting proper response. Even complaints in person are also not responded properly.
Worst experience with the builder."
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,"Not even eligible for 1 star

Specially NRI people don‚Äôt trust Casagrand and invest

Such worst experience with casa grand. Completely frustrated.

Two days of our time spent here are useless.

The buyer who pays the amount should take all responsibility and they should let know the casa grand team that we are liable to pay this amount and we have completed NOC.
They are saying 2021 they are not ready for NoC
Then how did they call us for NOC ? and to cover the small fixtures they took 2 years that‚Äôs not their problem all should be customer‚Äôs problem since we are not here we have to send someone to the office and request them to complete the house.

Intimation of next stage each customer‚Äôs responsibility, often they will change the CRM , and all the information customer should Provide to new CRM.
Because they not even get the knowledge transfer from the previous CRM."
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,"This review is exclusively for tenants. You will be treated as second-grade citizens. You will have no channel to ask anything, extreme supremacy of Supremus owners will not let you inside any WhatsApp or any groups. No decent democracy can be expected here. You will have to wander around for any updates, rules, and opetational changes. Often times, you and your children will be hurt by the poor culture and lack of decency prevailing here in this community. If you have pets, your life will become horrible here. Many tenants with pets have been succesully chased out by the fellow owners. So let the owners guard their castles by themselves. If you are looking for house, there are definitely better options nearby. Do not put your and yours self-respect on the line by looking at the fancy lighting at night. Just wanted to say one thing to the pride owners of ""Supremus,"" tenants are also human beings just like you and your family members. If you do not like tenants, kindly put up a board the entrance that no tenant is allowed."
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,"I wish someone give ratings on 6 th Dec 2023 after cyclone about water stagnation here... builder is also constructed casagrand ferns just near adayar river bank in west tambaram, right place for water stagnation. They are choosing wise place for construction. Just where water stagnates"
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,"It has around 700+ units but there is only one entrance and no proper separation of entry and exit, poor construction even a small nail can't hold with a load. Full of cracks and wall dampness...it's fully surrended with water stagnation"
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,Supremus Project is good and liked about the amenities provided by casagrand. But support from casagrand team(except handover team) and ICare support was not as per expectations. Make sure we have to get mail confirmation on each activity from purchase team to till get handover. This makes customer feel bizzare bcoz sales team will agree on something which processing team won't agree. Once the money is received the response will be very poor. Mostly they will not respond on phones. Happy with handover team support.
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,If you look for a rental home don't even come to Supremus we are been treated as low grade citizens if you have pet you are know as having a poisonous creature in your home here they have a plain plot near block 3 which is anadhinam where Supremus citizens occupied it as a play ground and refuse pet there
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,"Complete satisfaction with construction, smooth and professional handing over. Catering to individual customer needs. Staff behaved in a polite manner. All together we had a very good experience."
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,This review is for the tenants whoever plan to choose casagrand supremus be aware of the legal agreement that you are making with the owner because I was facing some issues.once after 11 months of tenure owner is asking the revised rent which is around 30 per cent from the actual rent and justifying by saying it's community standard I am demanding for it..I don't know does this site is located in city center to demand for such huge hikes???....
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,"Lack in building quality and maintaining, not able to reach and get services from builder or icare. Level of customer support after they sold property to customers is very poor. Waste of investment in Casagrand."
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,Casagrand I trust- The event was good. There were so many stalls for the kids to enjoy and adults to have fpod as well as buy grocery.
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,"Just been to the event organised in our community by casagrand Itrust team.
Was able utilise most of the offerings and wish them to continue their good work in the future too."
R297163,1 Year,Casagrand Supremus,"No proper communication.... It's very difficult to collect the keys.... Till booking only they speak good i guess.... After that no response nothing.....

R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"It's poss area of delhi, and have basic facilities which are required for human being life nothing so high but if you wanted to see your pocket empty just go to buy the property it will make you money less I am quite surprised to know the rate of property. And rent is also very high here. So it's better for you to go any other place to live in or to-let So that the property will not extortion your hard money."
R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,Best of DDA so far. Prime location. Solid structure. HIG flats are really worth. Peaceful and pollution free as compared to other prime localities of Delhi. Big park within the complex. Only 15 minutes drive from T3 IGI Airport. Many schools and institutes nearby.

R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,society with lots of issues - Water is the biggest challenge along with parking problems. Feels like a DDA slum with expensive flats. Cleanliness is also not properly managed. DO NOT THINK OF MOVING HERE unless this is your last option

R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,Going to be a Prime location & carpet area of flat is good enough. Specially corridor of 2nd floor in all blocks is better
R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"Lift not free for service person, like delivery boy, technicians, electrician, plumber, home service etc."

R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"Very Nice Society. Full Safe and secured.
Stray Dogs is the Major issue here. No one is taking action. Daily dogs bite Courier boys."
R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,Society is overpriced in terms of rent and corresponding amenities. RWA is also not competent to take the action against those who are doing illegal constructions
R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,Very good and newly built society. Upcoming metro station just at exit.
R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,Great neighborhood and friendly people. RWA Members are professional and know their jobs well. Adequate parking space. Beautiful Exterior according to a DDA flat
R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"A very nice society with a great atmosphere close to the Indira Gandhi International Airport. Aerocity is the nearest metro station üöâ and there are so many shops in and outside the society. A high class area to live in Vasant Kunj, some shortage of water was there but it's now resolved. Flats are cheaper than other areas in vasant kunj."
R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"Great society with lots of facilities loke basement parking, park, open spaces, on road locations, secure and near to airport and Gurgaon"
R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"I have stayed there for 5 months with my husband, let me tell you the truth behind the big scam going on. Firstly they will sell you or convince you to pay huge amount of rent, they will hide the truth about the stinky water from the flush tank then you will get to know the water scarcity problem and its not minimal problem its really huge. I had pathetic experience by the broker and the landlord as well. All the brokers are going to tell lies about the house so try not to buy or rent from this place. Our landlord didn‚Äôt gave back our security amount by calculating something by his own."
R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"Apartments are okey. But finishing touches needed and much wanting. Dust and mud all over the place . Minor construction activities are going on in the apartment blocks. The central greenery, the park they say, is good. Gadgets for senior citizens in the park area is very much usefull."
R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"There is huge water problem in this society.
There are thousands of follow ups everyday to get even 1 bucket of water.

Each Tower has 1 common tank on the top, if 1 flat uses more or uses the water for construction purpose, the entire tower suffers.
There is extremely limited supply time of 1 hr 3 times a day and most of the times it is missed or cut short due to poor management.

Quality of Water sucks.
Not suitable for kitchen or bathroom (flush water is not treated well and stinks).
Quality of construction sucks, basement parking is not suitable to park.

Rather go to d6 or even e2...!!"
R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,Very big society in Delhi. The area is good in the official location. But some parts of society found unhygienic and some parts are still in construction where raw materials are kept haphazardly
R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"DDA society having all sized flats with proper amenities. Just behind the Mahipalpur CNG station.
Metro Station is coming up in near future.
5-10 minutes away from IGI Airport.
20 minutes away from Gurgaon.
All facilities are in close vicinity."
R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"The place is spacious , clean , less crowded and green . The place is also well connected to the city ,airport, Gurgaon ,Dhaula Kuan and Safdarjung Railway Station. Nearby area is full of trees and less polluted."
R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"Very small flats. Google Rating in manipulated by brokers, don't fall for ratings. Go visit this place, specially after rain. In 3 years property price haven't appreciated by a dime, not a good investment."
R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"Not a well thoughout designing and construction. The place gets waterlogged in the rains and while I visited here, I could see two-three machines working together to remove the silt and clear the waterlogged areas, literally the mud.. DDA has built up small flats and has kept the prices of these flats exorbitantly high. Overall okay but the property deserves only a 3 star. Last but not the least, the DDA should tighten it's grip around brokers who are scattered all over and seem to be in tandem with the officials. And yes, like all other societies, DDA properties/flats are always extended illegally by almost every resident and this has to stop immediately."
R78455,1 Year,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,Had done hair cut. Professional and calm. They never try to sell their product to customers. Tried their clean up and it was very relaxing. Must visit them.
R78455,2 Years,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"Just moved to this society going by all the reviews and the look of it. But I'm highly disappointed and stuck here for a while due to the investment. A lot of people mentioned 'with all amenities' however basic amenity like water is a huge problem here. There is no MCD water. Its ground water. Each flat does not have individual tanks but building has common tank that too only 4000 liters. Kitchen water is different to bathroom water in terms of cleanliness which means bathroom water is dirty. Oh and yes it's hard water. So it affects your hair and skin majorly. There is no water most of the time as tank is empty mostly. Water is filled twice in a day. If you are on 6th or 7th floor there is no water pressure.

All houses have damp walls ( issues in construction) and lifts are mostly out of order. So all the best if you are planning to shift here."
R78455,2 Years,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"I am a resident and I will give you a geniune review.
Pathetic place..full of thieves, high TDS water, small rooms, children talking foul languages, water problems, seepage, zero maintenance of park and basement...endless list.
If you are spending money spend in a place which is worth."
R78455,2 Years,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"Beautiful area I want to leave here ,I love so much this area and ground is also very good. If anybody go there they feel peace and calm in this area. I love love love so much."
R78455,2 Years,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"I am sorry to say this that in this colony or society, it is evident that bonafide residents do not live but only majority malafide residents live."
R78455,2 Years,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"Room rent is very high,it's touch to Mahipalpur, I don't know why they make it high price, it's DDA ftals even it's out of range for middle class family"

R78455,2 Years,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,A lot of water issues with no solution. If you are willing to pay the rent asked; expect to not have flush water for 10 days a month.
R78455,2 Years,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"Best possible society in Vasant Kunj, close proximity to the Airport and other main areas."
R78455,2 Years,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,Went to visit my daughter‚Äôs friends house and it was such a nice complex with play area for children. Neat and clean and peaceful

R78455,2 Years,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"Water is a big issue apart from noise and dust from constant construction.
Rents are really hyped."
R78455,2 Years,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,Work in progress here... all flats are being ready... still lots of work Pending.. lots of dealers sit here waiting for buyers.. location is good..
R78455,2 Years,DDA C8 Vasant Kunj,"Water problems (drinking unavailability and rains excessive blockade), security issues, poor management of resources and infighting in the society. Stay away from this place if you can find an alternative."

I was happy to see a place for parking visitor cars

The entrance area is lavish & lifts are clean"
R322077,2 Years,Kolte Patil Tuscan Parkland,"The place is good and has good areas for people to walk, play, and celebrate. Separate play stations like squash, tennis, and swimming pool with gym, etc, make it a good society to live it. Flats are spacious. The approach road, second nect to raddission blu is the best option now to reach. Both side roads are done in RCC. A small rough patch at the start and end is pending, but all kinds of vehicles can move easily on it.

Do not take the road adjacent to the mall and Majestic project. It is half made, so higher possibly of getting stuck in a traffic jam if you are in a car."
R322077,2 Years,Kolte Patil Tuscan Parkland,"PS be careful of the 5 star ratings they're mostly from brokers.
Very bad society for bachelors, everyone living is very rude, the owner was super rude, the construction goes on 24/7 and is too noisy all the time, made the mistake of living there for 4 months, worst 4 months of my life, the owner was especially really rude towards the end and was a complete horror show.
Don't make the mistake of living here if you're bachelor your mental peace would be effed up.
Kudos if you're a family you'd enjoy the society and hate on bachelor's :)"

I'm writing this review at 6:53 in the morning after raising the complaint regarding the construction going on since 5:45-6 in the morning. Imagine waking up to the sound of drill machine in the adjacent house n complaining abt it n no one followed up on it. A year since livin' here , there has been multiple such incidents.

RR39038,1 Year,Bhagwati Bay Bliss,"1.logon se jyada kutte he is society me.
lifts always has bad smell of dogs.

2.also society is managed by only 4 arrogant corrupted committee members and one lazy appointed manager (also she is a gossip lover always seen with these 4 people telling bad things about residents)
who do not let anyone to talk or tell society issues.

3.many bachelors boys and girls live here. who orally tell people they are married and can always be seen with different partners. Specifically B wing.
im happy as im leaving the society. but do not choose this soiety even if u want to stay here for 6 months."
RR39039,1 Year,Bhagwati Bay Bliss,The society looks nice though. Some of the flats are spacious and have a see facing view. Lots of flats available for rent near by this locality. The advantage of buying a flat here would the accessibility of the Bamandongri railway station. It is just 600mtrs walking from this society.
RR39040,1 Year,Bhagwati Bay Bliss,"Simply Troublemaker and rude residents. Few of here have don't seem to be familiar with the term politeness and manners.

Not at all pet friendly society.. pet owners please avoid this society.

Irritating oversmart aunties will always unnecessary keep complainting about pets.
They have issues with pet barking within the house (that to when my pet hardly bark 4 -5 times a day) and have issue with the poor pet even when its leashed, they say it scares them.

All this complaint for my small breed dog. I wonder what would they say for larger breeds.

The place provides with good apartment complexes and amenities. Bahadurgarh city is a satellite town to national capital Delhi so many residents here are from Delhi and surrounding areas. Its coming up as a good cultural hub and cosmopolitan area in the old town of Bahadurgarh. Overall a fine place to live.
RR63946,1 Year,KLJ Heights,There is nothing like maintenance complain system or society maintenance forum. If there is seepage or any other maintenance related problem in ur flat or outside flat area....no action taken by maintenance dept even after many complains. Maintenance service is very unprofessional and irresponsible. Seepage and water coming back from drain pipe into the flats is very common. This puts question mark on the design and construction engineering of this society.

RR276056,1 Year,Chordias The Crown,I am the original owner of this account and someone has used my name and made a fake review complaining about the society. I am not going to tolerate this type of behaviour whosoever wrote this review using my name out of their personal grudges and envy will face the consequences and I will make sure to find you out and report it to the police. So either delete that or apologise for your actions. I am fully satisfied with the society I am not facing any problems as written by this fake account. The owners are really good and cooperative we live with harmony and love with all fellow society members but unfortunately this person cannot digest this fact and wants to strain our relations and I would never even dream of selling my precious flat.

We came to know about The Crown, visited it and fell in love with the design of the flat. We wanted a separate servant room and it‚Äôs a part of the package. Also, the society is close to the airport."
RR276061,1 Year,Chordias The Crown,I'm happy with the construction material used at The Crown. They have made these luxurious apartments designed to withstand seismic tremors and earthquakes. This is a feature we haven't seen in most apartments. The Crown is not only luxurious but also strongly built.

RR276063,1 Year,Chordias The Crown,Really bad building quality. The height of the apartment is too low. The owners are rude and only helpful till they need your money. Don‚Äôt buy here.

RR272801,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"A big township near Sohna where rates are shooting up like anything. Good for investment and living purpose, the project has good future as central park quality is good.

But very expensive as per the developments as it will take a few years to see proper life here. But I'm sure it's gonna change into city really soon.
"
RR272802,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"Fantastic facilities. I stayed for a week. This place is so beautiful, safe and I would come again and stay here."
RR272803,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,It is an upcoming project of Central Park which already have 2 of their townships in Gurgaon. This is the new one which totally gives a feeling of living in a resort with the best of the amenities including multi cuisine restaurant and spa. It is definitely going to be the best upcoming projects in Gurgaon.
RR272804,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"Coming residential Project with lots of options of villas and they started handover the flats.... Must visit... Central Park team, They celebrated each and every festival with great arrangements and joyfully as per their previous projects.. Time to time they also organised Fests.. These photographs are related to one of their organic fest in Flower Valley."
RR272805,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"Looks new. Installation work is very poor quality. Non standard size bathroom. Water and waste systems are not according to code. Very noisy place. Constant construction, crazy speed bumps.
Remote location. Smog and pollution similar to the rest of Delhi. Located between farms.
Most Ubers will cancel last minute. Intercity for Uber rides more expensive and limited.
Food service very limited. Restaurant inconsistent quality of food. Especially for delivery.
Shop is a mini market.

As said before correctly over hyped"
RR272806,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"This is the most beautiful and the most expensive township in Sohna area. The landscaping is very well maintained. The security is also very strict.
The location is bang on the new Sohna highway but it's a bit tricky to take the correct exit. If you miss the exit right after Mumbai expressway, then the next exit is after 5 kilometres and then take a U-turn to get to the right exit."
RR272807,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,There is charge for every event at least they should allow residents for free to attend the event and programmes but now they have a new business of charging and loot machana.
RR272808,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,Very beautiful entrance and we'll maintained society specially security. We are here to our relatives new house Pooja. House is fully furnished and spacious.
RR272809,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"Overhyped ,rooms are very small ,expensive too far from Delhi only security is good"
RR272810,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,Great place to live but needs to be better managed.
RR272811,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"I am really unhappy with my stay in this society. I am already working and to top it I need to face society issues, even after paying hefty maintenance fee.

Reasons to not buy in Central Park Flower Valley Sohna

1. Power cut off and backup- Constant power cut off that you rely almost to generator with generator charges which is 6 times the standard unit charge. Inefficient management team of the society

2. Hard water: 1500+ tds, no resolution of this issue till date. I already have started to get itchiness due to water.

3. Constant construction day and night environment remains dusty

On top of it rude and unprofessional behaviour on facilities staff, Not picking up calls.

Facilities Staff,Allowing people not staying in Central park for swimming pool access

I know these issues can be solved but they are not solved yet, its been over a year now. If anyone is planning to live here, think wisely before moving in."
RR272812,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"Unethical and illegal practices going on in this society. They are illegally relocating stray dogs and harassing feeders. Irrespective of that, the construction quality is poor. The land is not prepared for construction. Too many issues. The ones who already have a flat or have booked are regretting their decision. Overpriced for nothing. You'll get a better quality flat somewhere else in Sohna."
RR272813,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,Very location near highway in society beutiful garden favvra good looking good sectority good parking
RR272814,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"I had bought a house in Central Park, I thought I would enjoy a lot but I made a big mistake by coming here. Who has a problem here? No one listens to me at the helpdesk and they are charging maintenance charges. I don't know why the club house has not been built yet and they are charging for gym and swimming whereas our club house is not built then why are they charging for gym and swimming and if we call the facility center then no one calls, if we do then they say they are sending someone and no one comes. Think before buying a house here and there is no parking for our two-wheeler. We are paying maintenance charges just to pay the guard's salary"

RR272816,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"I love this society. I had never seen such beautiful flowers and the maintenance of society is at its peak. Total love for this society. The construction and the build quality of this society is top notch although this is on the highway only one dislike is that blinkit, zepto is not available here. Else you can find everything here in the society but they have their own cost which is on the higher side from the market. This society is actually far from the town at least 20 km but you can find peace of mind here."
RR272817,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"Inhumane activities in terms of 'development' by throwing out the long living furries familiar to the place out in the open to die, starving so selfishly. Unjustified behavior towards animal lovers. Not environment friendly."
RR272818,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"This place is beautiful from the inside very well maintained and the security is also good. Its a huge township so the apartments I had to visit was literally 1.5km from the main entry. There are low rise high rise , plots and even 1bhks here. They have a good restaurant but it was pretty expensive and the food was just okay. If you're looking to buy property for investment purposes this would be a good option to look at."
RR272819,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"Massive housing society with options of flats and villas. Like the Guards and the entrance.
Only negative is that you cannot reach there by public transport.

RR272820,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"I visited Flower Valley today . I liked your township . But Your sells office staff are not well behaved and in fact very rude. They are very old aged staff comparatively .

Kindly amend it as your name do maligned by these staffs.

RR272822,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"No doubt open space is really big whicb is the best part if you are lookingfor fresh air and some peace with nature. Green area is more than sufficient, well maintained, security is great. But apartment size is too small"
RR272823,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"Yet to be developed completely, over priced, only selling because of the Central Park as a brand. Sizes are too small to spend Crores from your pocket for low rises."
RR272824,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"NOT SAFE FOR HUMANS.. a lot of stray dogs.. So many dog biting incidents are taking place.. should do proper arrangements for stray dogs, every other day hear news of dog biting. CP must do something before it tarnishes its brand image.. Not safe for kids and elders to move out of the house alone."
RR272825,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"Good location, but very poor customer service. Bought a Mikasa plot, and quick to ask for monies - though some issues noted include -
1. Out of sight out of mind - will pay attention when it is their need vs the customers
2. Poor paper work processing - inaccurate agreements, with husband name screwed up, overcharged monies and took 3-4 weeks to refund. And when they did, a cheque was issued that had to be picked by us from their office. Ridiculous.
3. Inaccurate estimates and very poor support during agreement and registration. As a senior citizen of 75 yrs, she waited for over an hour in the May heat, and no support from Flower Valley
4. Advocate assigned by Flower Valley, did not even meet us once at the time of registration and instead would disconnect in the middle of the conversation. He would say I am busy. My plea of accelerating the process for my 75 yr old mother fell on deaf years.
Being an organization of repute, gross attention needs to be made to such issues as customers like me will make zero referrals and also post on social media"
RR272826,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"This place is at another level in Sector 32 33 on Sohna Road Gurugram. If you want to live a life stress free and in green covers then this is the place for you. There is so much open space and leisure activities that you will fall in love in one visit. My father in law has an independent floor there and believes me we love living a day or 2 there as the place is so beautiful with fresh air.
Sports like Badminton, Basket Ball court, Lawn Tennis court are all available. It's like a resort where you want to relax for a day or two."

Golf cart for to and fro for guest,can use them or you will love walking and moving inside. Parking in basement alloted to each flats and fast lift.

The guards are very helpful support staff is good too but on basis of this you can't move in here at this location nothing is there in this whole belt no swiggy zomato restaurant"
RR272832,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,Bhai ye central park flower valley is not for human beings‚Ä¶ it is maintained for stray dogs. Too many stray dogs here‚Ä¶ please be careful. No club till today‚Ä¶ over hyped‚Ä¶
RR272833,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"It is one of the best township of Delhi NCR. Once you will enter here you will find yourself in an another world which have lot of children parks, gardens, greenery, fish pond etc. Security is too good. Inside premises there is a specious restaurant (The necter) & club house. There is cart facility inside the premises which residents can use to move inside the campus. The only cons which I found that as per the cost, carpet area should be 10% more.

If this location suits you then you should definitely think to shift here."
RR272834,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"Beautiful place . Full.if greenery , flowers , all.amenities you can think of . To start with as a example, they have horse riding club in the township , good security, all levels"
RR272835,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,The society is well planned and maintained well. It's one of the best societies in Sohna. I had visited the restaurant located in the society it's pretty good. It might be a good investment here.
RR272836,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"It feels like we are in some other world.very clean , beautiful and safe also"
RR272837,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"Living in this township is an experience in itself. It's safe, clean, green, well managed and maintained, and the facility management is very helpful. The Sikh regiments gaurds present at every point is great, they are very courtious and helpful, the app used for security access and also to servic management is great. The only con is that utilities like Zomato or 1mg do not provide service in this location. But Amazon works pretty well so no complaints. And as for Zomato we do have a in house restaurant ""Nectar""and the food is good and so is the delivery and dining services. I am still exploring all the features here but the horticulture is excellent and well maintained which is pleasing to the eyes. It's very safe for kids and that's the primary reason I decided to move here and I am not disappointed so far"
RR272838,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"Posting as a owner ----Unprofessional staff ,no timeline of Possession, worst customer care never call back inspite of reminders ,mostly staff excuse -(busy in meetings).......sarkari attitude overall ,lacks knowledge overall ,sad situation."
RR272839,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,Nice and built up society. Security officers are helpful. Society still needs to work on long strolling options and ensure all path are clean from dust and paved.
RR272840,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"Very pretty and well maintained. The Nectar restaraunt is large with good Mumbai cuisine. We did not try another cuisine. Rotis, Naans, Rogan Josh, Chicken, Palak paneer, raita and jamuns and rasmalai. All good and service was great considering we were 15 individuals all adults !"
RR272841,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"I looked the property it's very beautiful and pleasent ambience but below are some red flags
1.monopoly of businesses inside the Town
2.overly priced flats
3.Location is far off
4.It has plots towers villas flats all together and with good margins in prices looks like it's economically barriered .Kids will feel one area is farm houses and they live in small space right in front of those villas plus amenities are also divided as per the space you are buying
5.ambience is good horticulture team is good.parking again is limited."
RR272842,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"Living in Flower Valley has been an amazing experience for me. I wake up to chirping birds, a refreshing breeze, and a view of lush greenery, every day! It is amazing to watch the sunset as I have my tea."
RR272843,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,I was thinking of investing here as an NRI investor. Then heard horror stories of others who have invested. These guys are cheating people by converting drain lands to green areas and selling plots. A friend started digging up a plot for construction and the entire place was flooded with water. The builder doesn‚Äôt care and my friend has stopped construction. His plot is now stuck - no construction. BUY SOMETHING ELSE GUYS
RR272844,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,Best property after DLF in Gurgaon
RR272845,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"Rude and unprofessional guards at entry gate, who have no regard for the time of the visitors. No signage in the basement parking, one keeps going in circles"
RR272846,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"We went there to check out few properties. Absolutely marvellous. Huge township with lots of greenery and amenities. We however won't buy here as it felt over priced considering it's located at Sohna which is yet to get big and it's difficult to travel to and fro to office at Gurgaon daily. Public transport at Sohna is a problem too.

Otherwise there is no such big and we'll planned township in and around Gurgaon area like this."
RR272847,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,If you like living in peace and love nature this is the best gated community to live in near Gurgaon it‚Äôs far from Gurgaon on km scale but the highway is so good that the time taken to reach there is less then sticking in a jam in Gurgaon sector for more then an hour while you are just 500 meters from your home. The Parks are good and well maintained. They have lots of flower pots and maintaining up-to there name of flower Valley . It‚Äôs not just a name they actually maintained the flowers.
RR272848,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,I've have been coming to this place for 2 years now. Flower Valley is such a lovely place and kudos to Central Park for giving Gurugram a great residential concept living place like this. I've never seen any developer deliver anenities long before possession. Just love this place and keep coming back to it.
RR272849,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,Pathetic place . A house got completely burnt on Diwali due to lack of fire fighting measures. I was about to buy one flat but now I would recommend nobody to even consider ...save your money and invest elsewhere

DONT BUT... STAY AWAY"
RR272852,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"It's a great peaceful society, Ultra luxurious with 20 acres of central green great, lavish clubhouse with indoor and outdoor sports activities, great location near NH 8"
RR272853,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"Overpriced...that‚Äôs the only word I have for this township....the plot rates are close to those in certain well respected localities in Gurgaon like Malibu Towne , Rosewood City etc , though the landscaping of the project is beautiful and it has the brand tag of Central Park but the location is far off and adjacent societies in the area are offering flats at almost half the rates , even a company like Central Park can‚Äôt keep a 100% premium for its name and amenities provided...if the prices would‚Äôve been 25-30% lower then it would‚Äôve made sense...due to already high prices at present don‚Äôt expect it to give bumper returns in future."
RR272854,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"Really small sizes and exorbitant prices for a rural area, their prices are same as in Vasant Kunj, i will never invest in such a place, also earlier buyers except land see very less property appreciation"
RR272855,1 Year,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"Ever since the widening of the road has begun, the entrance & exit to the building is all broken. Poorly maintained property. Barring 2-3 large occupiers, the building is empty. Not the ideal place for small office setup"

RR272860,2 Years,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,"Never buy a property from Central Park.
They ll finalise a booking in one amount and on possession they ll increase the amount by centain percentage. They are the biggest chor in the market.
No body is able to take possession of their flat because of this. If you want to cancel then they ll deduct huge amount from you already paid amount so that you can not even cancel. They are simply playing with customers hard earned money and their employees are all mis-selling saying something and doing something else. Overall top to bottom every body is a CHOR in Central Park.
Avoid buying any property in it."
RR272861,2 Years,Central Park Flower Valley Cerise Floors,Township is good and well maintained. Its just far from Gurgaon and its very much over priced. It's priced at a price tag what one could get in Gurgaon itself.

Residents have an easy access to NH8 and Dwarka expressway. Society has only 7 towers with abundant open green spaces. The construction quality of towers should have been better since within 6 years lot of patches/cracks have surfaced on the facade of building and basement leakage has been a perennial concern for residents.

RR369943,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"Casagrand Boulevard ‚Äì Honest Review After Visit Visited Casagrand Boulevard today for a relative‚Äôs housewarming ceremony. The apartment complex looks well built and has a modern architectural design. One of the highlights is the generous open space ‚Äî it‚Äôs refreshing to see more open area than built-up structures, which adds to the overall appeal and breathing room. The community has all standard amenities like a swimming pool, clubhouse, and playground, which are great for families and social activities. However, maintenance doesn‚Äôt seem to be up to the mark, which is disappointing given the premium appearance of the property. One major drawback was the behavior of the security personnel. Their attitude came across as rude and unwelcoming, which leaves a poor impression, especially for visitors. Overall, Casagrand Boulevard has potential, but the management needs to improve maintenance and train the security staff better to provide a consistent living experience."
RR369944,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,The pool is too small for adults to use it only 4 feet which should be 5-6 feet. Handover was delayed for a long duration
RR369945,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"The builder has great reputation in Chennai but worst in BLR. The project is delayed for 2+yrs, no proactive, communication, no timely QC, need to chase them everything. CRMs do not respond, Many issues noted in execution of the project. Anything more than 4 Star here is a fake review with just 1 or 2 lifetime reviews. so beware. The homeowners now have a lot of work to do to get things up and running. Buy Casagrand property in BLR at your risk of finance and peace."
RR369946,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,We bought a flat in 2022 and they promised completion of the project by 2023 March from this builder initially everything ok when they were chasing us for payment but now everything is horrible and a nightmare after we have done all the payments. No one responds to us about handover or the documents required for bank purposes. Our CRM NIRMALA is not picking calls and when we call from different number she picks and says I‚Äôm preparing your docs and send you shortly but that never happens and it‚Äôs been days. Please assign people with responsibility to handle such important issues. We have paid more than a crore and people don‚Äôt respond about handover or documents despite multiple follow ups.
RR369947,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"We bought a flat from this builder initially everything was good, but now everything is horrible. No one responds to us about handover or the documents required for bank purposes. Our manager Nirmala is not picking calls and when we call from different number she picks and says I‚Äôm in lunch and will call back and it‚Äôs been days. Please assign people with responsibility to handle such important issues. We have paid more than a crore and people don‚Äôt respond about handover or documents despite multiple follow ups"
RR369948,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"Same issue with me as well. Bought a flat from this builder and initially they pushed so much to get all the payments on time and the CRM Srinivas has resigned without even informing me by asking to get all the details for registration. I connected with the bank and got the DD etc. , later I got to know that he is not there and I was clueless about whom to contact. Then got to know Nirmala is the manager and when tried to connect with her , she is not picking calls or no response to emails. Even if she responds she says someone will call you or i will respond, still no response at all. I believe entire CRM team in Bangalore for all the projects are not good. If you want to suffer in frustration till you get the possession in Casagrand , go for it . Otherwise , please stay away from this builder."
RR369949,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"After waiting for 2 years took HO .Faced lots of issues in registration , getting in touch with CRM etc,Lots of delay in HO.Now after taking HO feel completely disappointing ,for simple issues we have to reach out to Icare .They take their own time and dont respond to emails or calls .Moreover in site no one knows Boulevard plan and design they easily provide wrong info to flat owners and create more icare tickets and issues.Its better avoid buying from this builder in bangalore .Icare team is complete waste of Time, they dont respond to phone calls .will sending email to Icare help solve issues ?"
RR369950,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"The customer support/operational team are excellent and go to any extent to solve the operational issues. But Sales, CRM etc are very difficult to catch and does not give a good feeling of the Company culture. No escalation to head of departments work and no one calls back listening to the problems. However, the quality of the construction, design etc are good and have delivered to the commitment. If the management support is given to customers woes, especially from CRM head, casagrand can get 5*."
RR369951,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"Great architecture. Wellness themed community with ample fresh air, greenery and modern amenities. Ideal place to live with your family regardless of their age. Terrific location in terms of connectivity with the rest of the city."
RR369952,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"Most pathetic management!!!! I am extremely disappointed with the management of Casagrand. I purchased a flat (F-107) in their Casagrand Boulevard project, and the experience has been nothing short of frustrating. Despite numerous attempts and considerable effort on our part, we faced significant delays in receiving the handover, which also included delay charges‚Äîcharges for which we were not at fault. In November 2024, we paid Rs. 66,000 for mosquito mesh installation, which was supposed to be completed before the handover. Since then, we have repeatedly requested and followed up to have it installed‚Äîideally before moving in, before our interiors were set up, and certainly before our housewarming ceremony. However, all our efforts have been in vain. Even after moving in, we have been diligently following up on this matter for months. We raised a support ticket three months ago, but there has been no progress. When we inquire, the responses from their IFM team (Maria, Akash, Rajesh) and the project team (Nishant) are unhelpful, with the issue being passed from one team to another without resolution. At this point, I feel utterly exhausted and helpless, and I am now considering legal action, although I am unsure if it will resolve the matter. I STRONGLY ADVISE ANYONE CONSIDERING PURCHASING FROM CASAGRAND, ESPECIALLY IN BENGALURU, TO THINK TWICE. THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE POST-PURCHASE IS EXTREMELY LACKING, AND AS A CUSTOMER, YOU WILL OFTEN FEEL NEGLECTED, WITH ISSUES BEING BOUNCED BETWEEN TEAMS WITHOUT ANY TANGIBLE SOLUTIONS."
RR369953,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"Bought an apartment at Casagrand Boulevard, and they've cheated us! 1. Reduced the private terrace area without prior notice, despite us paying for it and having it in the sales agreement. 2. Diverted from the RERA approved floor plan. 3. Now claiming the unit isn't under our name! We've already sent two legal notices, but no response. They have a whole team of frauds, their CRM, Nirmala, Manikandan, Khadar, Pratap, Sheena and so many other people... they say they will check and get back to us, and they don't care about other people's hard earned money, they will never reply to any of our texts, call, messages......Casagrand Builders‚Äîthis is unacceptable! #CasagrandCheats #ConsumerRights"
RR369954,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"I am the owner of one of the unit in Casagrand boulevard. The quality of the unit is not up to the mark. No words to describe the CRM Team. I am sure, you can see many scenario below describing the quality. My current CRM is Nirmala and Priya. One of my CRM is top achiever for last couple of years but still no proper response. They just play the blame game. Don‚Äôt waste your hard earned money with Casagrand. Please avoid at all cost."
RR369955,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"I am flat owner of D 302, my handover was completed today, the customer delight team was exceptional in the way things was handled, Revana and Akash supported great to ensure my house warming happens on time as planned , Kudos to them. My experience with CRM team was horrible and pathetic, one of the worst CRM is Nirmala, they never respond to calls nor call back , false promises over false promises, though I paid all my payments on time, I was charged a huge delay interest fee, I had to fight back and show emails to prove to waive off‚Ä¶. Pre sales excellent , I would like to thank Basheer for his guidance‚Ä¶ post sales , CRM team horrible and awful. After I got a new CRM Shubha ‚Ä¶ she helped in getting things done on time ‚Ä¶ very stress filled journey‚Ä¶ Thanks to Shubha for taking care things and expediting. Post Registration‚Ä¶ great experience‚Ä¶ I loved the design and the low rise concept ‚Ä¶ great project with Ample amenities and very good build quality , top branded fittings , I feel good I made the right choice from a building project standpoint. Waiting for a Casagrand to confirm when the project would be move in ready. Thank you ‚Ä¶"
RR369956,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"I am happy to share my experience with Casagrand boulevard.. today I got my unit handover , customer delight team is very polite and helpful to guide all the details.. keys handover process went very well and it was well organised by the team."
RR369957,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"I own an apartment in CG Boulevard F Block. We had few wonderful experiences with the Customer delight & Handover team of CGB. Dileep Raj is an able Leader of this team helping us in scheduling our Handover at our requested time, ensuring all accessories are properly handed over & ensuring any minor issues after handover are rectified/closed. Revanth is a STAR performer with smiling soft spoken nature helping us lots during Handover in procuring the accessories along with ensuring power & water supply during housewarming ceremony along with minor rectifications & modifications thereafter. Akash is a silent individual who lets his work talk for him. Handover process was smooth due to his excellent handling of documents, keys mgmnt, offers etc & helping with post handover modifications & rectifications. Overall, the Customer delight & Handover team of CG Boulevard is best CG team. Above rating is only for CGB Delight team."
RR369958,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,Good project with tons of amenities. Quality of the home fittings is excellent . My experience with the CRM team was horrible as they don‚Äôt respond to calls mails sms. Customer Delight team was more accountable and responsive as they resolved concerns in timely manner and handed over the apartment.
RR369959,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"I'm so sorry for rating CGB 1 star. Actually, you deserve 0 star. Casagrand Team is well trained for giving false commitments,playing with our trust, making people fool, and all kinds of miss communication,frauds, bluffing, etc. Although the sale agreement is a legal document of sales agreement, it is just a piece of useless paper for this builder. RERA is just useless as the builder gets what it wants. If anyone want to play with your hard earn money than only you should deal with Casagrand group or else best option I suggest to do charity of half amount but never ever opt for Casagrand builders there are the biggest cheaters. April 2022 I purchased my unit by Jan 2023 by whole unit was full fledged ready but still I hadn't got occupancy it is now Nov 2024, I completed my registration, interiors everything still struggling for occupancy. In every call they postpone things for 15 days than another 15 days and like this cycle continues.....Most importantly the think hardly these people pick up calls or revert on your mail , whenever they revert you people feel like that you had won jackpot because it is rare that CG team revert because they are the most busiest team. It is statutory warning to all my readers to invest in CASAGRAND properties only if you are ready for charity or want to burn your hard earn money in one blunder move. Sale agreement is just a piece of junk paper."
RR369960,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"I initiated the purchase of a 3bhk flat back in June 2021 with the understanding that it would be delivered by October 2022 as promised by the Casagrand sales team. However, as we approach nearly three years since the initial booking, there's still a lack of clarity on the final handover date. Despite consistent efforts to obtain information, the CRM team, led by Nirmala, has been consistently providing inaccurate deadlines. Attempts to escalate the matter to senior management have been met with silence; emails and calls remain unanswered. Each time contact is made, it's met with new, uncertain dates, if one is fortunate enough to even get through to them. Despite my persistent follow-ups over the past six months, I've been denied access to physically inspect my unit, only receiving images of the flat. The latest communication stipulates that no unit inspections will be allowed until the issuance of the OC (Occupancy Certificate), yet there's no clarity on when that might occur. The lack of transparency and accountability in this process is deeply concerning, and I'm left in limbo, uncertain about the status and quality of the property I've invested in. Below is the image shared by engineer of the new flat that is just constructed."
RR369961,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"I request all the buyers to think twice before investing your life long savings on a home here. Come and visit their just finished Royce project and make a decision. All the 5 star reviews are either given by their employees or paid reviews. They will first lure the buyers showing fancy amenities and hide the actual defects of the home. Their CRM team is the worst. They literally made us cry. They do everything possible not to get things done. it‚Äôs not a Customer Relation Management , it is customer torture management. Nobody will be there to listen to your concerns and address. They show you one thing and build something else. There is a gap in the above balconies (see the pic) where everything falls in our home and is even worse when it rains. I have no idea why they have given this master design. There are so many such defects like these. Please don‚Äôt get cheated by the cunning sales team. They don‚Äôt mean a single word what they say."
RR369962,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"A nightmare. Sales team promised heaven and delivered hell.for two months I'm fighting with CRM and customer delight.no municipal or borewell water supply.so many design faults in the flat .we have to spend money from our pocket to rectify.no reply to my emails raising various issues from customer delight.left to have a tussle with junior staff who run around like headless chicken while top management staff are partying in spain.i thought I was alone but when I checked with other residents, they have worse issues.its very sorry state of affairs.i post this with so much pain feeling absolutely disillusioned.please don't send me an automated mail expressing regret and some useless helpline number and email address.goodnight"

RR369964,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"Horrible Builder ‚Äì Management, CRM, and VP in Bangalore Are Completely Incompetent I have purchased a 3BHK flat i recommend to Stay away from this builder if you care about your sanity. The entire team‚Äîfrom the CRM to the VP in Bangalore‚Äîis utterly useless. They only call when they want your money and then vanish, ignoring emails and phone calls. They demanded payment before even signing the agreement‚Äîhow does anyone get a loan without an agreement in place? The CRM team is a joke, trained to give robotic, rehearsed responses while doing nothing to actually solve any problems. Management and the VP refuse to honor the agreed possession date of October 2023 (+3 months), pushing the RERA date of December 2024 instead. They slap on false delay charges but conveniently ignore their responsibility to compensate for their own delays. The flat is full of defects‚Äîcracks, dampness‚Äîand their only solution is the laughable promise that it‚Äôll be ‚Äúfixed at handover.‚Äù They even failed to find water after digging 700 meters for borewells in Bangalore, showing complete incompetence. The entire operation, from top to bottom, is unprofessional, deceitful, and incapable of delivering on their promises. And let me guess their response? ‚ÄúWe are looking into this, please contact us at .......‚Äù This is just more of their usual empty talk to make it look like they care, but trust me‚Äîthey don‚Äôt. They won‚Äôt solve anything. It‚Äôs just a desperate attempt to look good on paper while ignoring the real issues."
RR369965,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the CRM team‚Äôs handling of our unit and the overall customer experience. Unfortunately, not only has the construction quality been unsatisfactory, but the customer service, particularly from the CRM team, has also been highly disappointing. During our recent visits for unit inspections, we encountered several issues, including: *Gaps around water taps and windows *Damaged beading on the balcony door *Unevenly laid tiles Each time we raised these issues, we were only able to speak with the site engineer, who informed us that the CRM team would be notified. However, despite multiple attempts to resolve these matters, we have never had direct communication with the CRM team, as they only respond via phone. To date, no resolution has been provided for the issues we‚Äôve highlighted. Given the scale and reputation of this project, I expected a much more professional and responsive approach from the CRM team. Unfortunately, their lack of engagement and accountability makes it feel as though we are being treated like customers at a chaotic marketplace rather than a prestigious project. This has been extremely frustrating, and it seems as though our concerns are not being taken seriously. Despite sending several escalation emails, including one to the Vice President, there has been no meaningful response. The lack of communication and follow-up is unacceptable, particularly for a project of this magnitude, and it raises serious questions about accountability at higher levels. If I share feedback, I only receive a standard reply directing me to generic contact channels, which have not provided any resolution. I kindly request that you refrain from sending the same templated response again. Please only reply if you are genuinely addressing our concerns."
RR369966,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,One of the most horrible builder with a terrible team of people. Have booked a house at casa grand boulevard Bangalore. You can keep calling them they will not answer. Email them you will get no response. Please be careful when you book your house. The builder has a very inefficient team. You‚Äôre HR are rude when you talk. This is a very serious matter so think twice before you get into it.

RR369968,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"**Avoid This Builder ‚Äì Unprofessional and Deceptive Practices** I urge anyone considering purchasing a flat here to reconsider. My experience has been nothing short of a nightmare, plagued by unresponsive communication, false promises, and blatant disregard for customer concerns. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of my ongoing ordeal: - **No Replies to Emails, Unanswered Calls**: Despite numerous attempts to get in touch, the customer service and CRM teams have consistently ignored emails and phone calls. The management seems entirely disconnected from their customers. - **False Delay Charges and Broken Promises**: Despite providing evidence and following up relentlessly, they refuse to acknowledge their mistakes regarding wrongful delay charges (they put wrong dates on payment schedule to make money and give lame excuse by saying this is company policy). Instead, they act like tape recorders, repeating rehearsed responses, without addressing or resolving the actual issues. - **Non-Compliance with Agreement Dates**: As per the agreement, possession was expected in October 2023 (+3 months grace period). Now, they refuse to honor the contractual date, claiming they are only following RERA's date of December 2024. This is a blatant disregard for the signed agreement, and they conveniently ignore the clause that makes them liable for delay compensation, instead imposing delay charges on us to avoid paying what‚Äôs rightfully owed. - **Quality Control Failures**: The flats are riddled with defects ‚Äì cracks, dampness, and other quality issues. Despite raising these concerns, they‚Äôve done nothing except provide generic responses, claiming these issues will be resolved at handover. It‚Äôs absurd to think that they‚Äôll magically fix these problems at the last minute, given their track record. This builder has demonstrated complete incompetence at every level. They operate without accountability, and the management is either unaware of the ground reality or deliberately turning a blind eye to these glaring issues. I implore the CEO and higher-ups to step in and rectify this mess before more customers fall victim to their deceptive practices. If you're considering buying here, **beware**. They‚Äôve shown no commitment to honoring agreements or providing decent customer service. "

RR369970,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"I am writing this review out of frustration and disappointment with Casagrand Boulevard. This has been one of the worst experiences I've ever had with a property developer. SHAME on the OWNER and employees of Casagrand for feeding your family and children in this dishonest way. By cheating thousands of customers and playing with their feelings, emotions, and hard-earned money, you are inviting bad KARMA that will inevitably come back to affect YOUR OWN FAMILY AND CHILDREN. If any sudden de**h occurs in your family, it is your own responsibility because the curses of thousands of people will not simply leave you. I trusted you and paid my money, but I am clear from my side. It's time for you to think about your actions. I would strongly advise anyone planning to buy property from Casagrand to think twice. Their management is clearly incompetent, and their customer service is non-existent. mainly they are focusing on how to cheat the customer"

RR369972,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"I have a flat in J Block at Casagrand Boulevard. Recently I took handover of my unit. The Customer Delight Team was responsible for handing over our unit and it was a wonderful experience to say the least. Rajeshwaran, Akash, Nirup and Revanth ensured that the customer felt really welcomed . Right from the festive decoration of the unit, the ribbon cutting, the deep cleaning of the flat to the gifts, key handover and document handover, everything was organized well and the effort was really commendable. I was delighted and my family also enjoyed a lot."
RR369973,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"Casagrand Boulevard had promised possession by October 2023, whereas not done till now. Customers are paying home loan now for nearly 2+ years and casagrand does not provide any updates on the progress ! Else the project is nice with good amenities. Customer is kept in dark Now with their delays of more than a year, these delay charges are put on customers this is really not good !"
RR369974,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,World life style amenities are there I'm very enjoyed while saw the project. Good Ambience
RR369975,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,Casagrand never keep their promise. They do handover after 4years from their committed deadlines. I booked a flat in Casagrand Boulevard and waiting for the registration till now.. it‚Äôs been 4 years now. If u dream to own home.. please don‚Äôt buy from this builder.. once they receive 90% of our money .. they make us to beg for handover. Casagrand Never delivers on time. Poor quality. Good at doing sales. Very bad at customer service.
RR369976,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"Hi I am a customer of this boluevard project. These guys have been the worst team I have ever seen through out my life. especially the CRM Team. They all promised me that this will be delivered in OCT 2023. now its August 2024. I have initiated my loan as well. and paying rent too. I wish there is a word worst than ""worst"". I will refer that for these people. It has never been smooth. The CRM never responds. On top of that why the hell are we not allowed to visit our own units? What are you hiding there. This is total bull-shit. We all should have been gone for other real estate developers. And I will really appreciate if any customer can add me to whatsapp group. Or if there is not any, we can create a group. If any one wants to register consumer case on these people, I am ready 24*7. I really feel, we should file a complaint. Also, they are imposing fine on me for some delayed payment around 40-45K. I mean why? First you people should commit to your words. Take a stand for yourself first. so pathetic these ppl are"
RR369977,2 Years,Casagrand Boulevard,"My experience with Casagrand boulevard was above and beyond expectations. They have made everything so easy. The customer care representative was so impressive & co-operative. The solution to all aspects like home loans etc. were provided in one place ‚Äìso we could be sure all of our choices. Our Casagrand boulevard consultant explained all of the standard features and possible upgrades of boulevard. I can‚Äôt express how stress free and easy the process was to select our features and buy our dream home. Best amenities I have come across so far. It went so smoothly; we knew we made the right choice by choosing Casagrand boulevard. The service, standard features and commitment to quality was great. We have booked our second flat as well with them and the journey so far is better and consistent.

RR369981,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"I am writing this as an ex customer of Casagrand Lorenza- one of the worst builders in India, they have completely taken me for a ride right from the time I bought the property till I finally decided to return it to them for building irregularities. I have been made to run from pillar to post and repeatedly follow up just to ensure my basic rights are protected. Especially with women they become even more callous and tough. They have charged me a rent of 65k per month just because I was not in a position to vacate when they demanded. Please don‚Äôt ever buy their properties or you will suffer."
RR369982,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"This property has plenty of legal issues, just like any other Casagrand properties in Bangalore. Do not fall for their scam. They had promised to refund our booking amount within 45 days and had also given a written confirmation, however we are still struggling to get the money. They might promise you that processes have gotten better now, but that‚Äôs just a lie. The occupancy certificate of another Casagrand property was canceled in Bangalore. With the kind of shoddy and illegal work that they do, Boulevard will also have the same fate. Do not buy this property and waste your money."
RR369983,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"Worst builders in Bangalore, quality wise its very low standard materials used in every stage, Fraud CRM team( Prathap/Sheena) They dont even respond properly to mails and they will not intimate you on delays, we have to keep on mailing/calling them asking for updates. do not waste your hard earned money and time."
RR369984,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"Their deadline has been changing like the electoral promises of political parties. They have been making me run for a simple site visit since last 6 months giving unrealistic reasons. Due to WFH, I am staying in my home state. So I cannot visit the site anytime. Whenever I plan and come as per their promises, they don't allow me to visit it. I have wasted so much money. Also I booked this because they had said it would be ready by September 2023. But it seems it will never come. Earlier their sales team executive Arti was there bluffing me. Now we have another Asha in her place."

RR369987,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,Booked this flat in July 23 and was assured to get the possession by October 23 and same was mentioned in the agreement also. Till date no update from CRM team. Everytime either they don't pick the call or give some future date to wait. They were behind me while getting the NOC from bank to get the loan amount and then stopped communication. It crossed the grace period of 3 months also and doesn't look like when this will be ready. Highly disappointed.
RR369988,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"I have booked a 3bhk unit here in 2021 July and still waiting for handover. Sales team was so flashy with their sales techniques and i fell for their handover timeline of December 2022. Only during the sale deed i came to know the handover is expected by October 2023. Even during the sale deed the CRM, sales along with engineering team discussed with me and made me agree for the sale deed with the assurance of handover by March 2023. however they never treat you as customer and update you anything. Initial three or four months they sent some monthly progress report and after that it was all lie.. After 13 months of delay from original commitment they gave during booking, and after multiple follow ups to visit the unit for last three months, i visited the unit today and completely shocked to see the progress. It is nowhere ready for handover until June 2024. Only god knows when it will happen. The most frustrating things are their stupid and illogical mistakes in the unit design compared to model house. they have shown the model house with all good and elevated designs and when it comes to the unit they don't even care to update the customer about the changes that we can expect in our unit compared to the model house. I as a customer agree to the fact that every detail cannot match with the model house. However, when sales team explain their floor plan with key selling points like inbuilt wardrobe to give a spacious bedroom feel, elevated foyer design, grid fall ceiling in all toilets and etc they don't even care to explain what to expect when we finalise our unit compared to model house. they just focused on the money in our pockets. once that is taken from the customer's pocket, that's all they will go underground. they don't even care to discuss anything. one small example here, look at this foyer window. this is a toilet window which they fixed for the elevated and luxurious foyer design they spoke about during the model house demo. according to site engineer, it is due to some mistake in the engineering drawings and they don't even ready to accept the mistake and change it to the original one. instead they say it is the same window for all the units and now we cannot change. this is complete nonsense, stupidity and unprofessional to deal with. i mean, how come they are saying they are the best in the market and showing all those awards in the marketing offices.. CRM Nirmala is my biggest trouble in this whole journey. i mean, who in this world would agree to all this nonsensical mistakes. I am looking for their superiors to intervene and help me with sorting these issues one by one."
RR369989,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"Hi everyone, One of my friend booked in this project last year, and 90% of the amount of the apartment he paid. Now this marketing person doesn't bother to reply to his mails. They promised to him to give him possession by January but nothing is updated from their side. I was planning to book an apartment over there but bound to change my decision.Most unprofessional attitude towards the valuable customers those who booked in CASA GRANDE BOULEVARD. Now my friend is staying in a rented house and as well as he is paying the emi for the flat which he booked. HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT AND THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE CUSTOMER."
RR369990,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"Casagrand Boulevard, Lorenza and many Casagrand Projects are delayed and CRM doesn't pick calls after receiving Money. Worst Builder. Several RERA complaints are against them and they don't appear in court too. Fraud Builder"
RR369991,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,I was just one step away to book a unit here in casagrand boulevard. The price they mention was 5300 per sqft. So when the actual comes up they will include 12% gst on top of the total price which I have seen no where seen in the market. Also they promised to allow interior to be done from august 2023.(joke) Still the work is going on. Feel pitty for the owners who have booked/purchased the units there. After checking the review i am very glad that I haven‚Äôt booked the unit. God saved me.
RR369992,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,I'm facing the same issue as per previous experience shared by Anjali S. Never ever invest in any casagrand project. The CRM team is a well trained liar and sales team is a top notch scammer
RR369993,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"The team will promise you stars and moon till you fall in their trap. Once the booking is done it's difficult to get any sensible and transperent response from them. All they do is LIE and give False promises. I have been literally pleading them for site measurements and every time they say they will allow in another 10days which they are pushing from past 3-4 months. I escalated the issue to the management, and to my surprise, they don't even bother to respond to the emails/complaints. I have dealt with other builders in the past and trust me they value/respect their customers unlike thai builder. It's a lesson learnt, I don't think I will be trusting this builder and their team hereafter."
RR369994,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"Poor quality, finishing isn't good and on top of it, fools customers by quoting low prices but all inclusive (except registration) prices are very high. Don't get fooled by their pricing in ads. After visiting, they reveal the real price which is way higher almost 40% more than the advertised price. I visited 5 of their properties 4 in north Bangalore and 1 in south, everywhere their pricing model is same. Advertise rock bottom price and reveal sky high price after visiting. Such price variation isn't there in any of top builders of bangalore. Don't waste your valuable time if you are thinking of buying in the price range they quote in the ads. Add minimum of 35-40%% on top of it. Hazen quoted at 69 but all inclusive (barring registration) comes to around 98L for a 2BHK. Same is the case in boulevard too. Didn't like the quality of finishing also."
RR369995,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"My brother booked flat during pre-launch in December 2020, when it was promised that the handover will be done in 18-24 months. Forget 24 months, it‚Äôs been more than 36 months since the project started and it hasn‚Äôt been handed over yet. The regular updates have also stopped coming. Totally unprofessional and customers have been taken for a ride. Don‚Äôt know on what basis SBI agreed to service loans for this project."
RR369996,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"Casagrand is synonymous for word ""Seepage"". I have bought a house in Royce project but there are multiple places where Seepage issues are observed. The iCare team is just for name sake and they don't bother to attend customer complaints even after 3 months!!! Never seen so irresponsible people and they hardly care for their customers. The referral bonus which I am supposed to get is still a distant dream even after multiple follow-ups. My advice for new buyers, where ever it may be - Come and visit Casagrand Royce and then make the decision. Don't go by their reputation in Chennai. Don't waste your hard earned money by investing in them. The senior folks in the company hardly care and are deaf to any issues you raise. Even the small scale builders are better than them. P.S All the positive reviews you see are from their own employees and not true!"
RR369997,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,I had a good experience with registration and handover. Mr Rajeshwaran and his team did an excellent job. Looking forward to moving in shortly
RR369998,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,Very poor quality of construction i have taken Signature Unit but quality is below third grade quality.
RR369999,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"I am coming back here after 3 months just to show the amount of negligence shown by casagrand builders in rectifying the reported issues. Future buyers, before investing your hard earned money, be very assured that this great customer experience will be given to you as well. The so called customer delight team of Casagrand called me and asked me to take down the review with a false promise of rectifying the issues. It has been more than 6 months now where it's me who has to follow up every single day with them, multiple people, multiple explainations of the issues but yet no execution from their side. It's just plain waste of time, effort and money along with loads of false promises made to the customers. None of the good reviews are given by the real customers, it's either their own sales team or their family members, some reviews maybe paid ones as well and hence don't fall into this trap of them having decent reviews."
RR370000,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"The house is fine but please don't ever do the mistake of booking this house thinking you can retract later. Your booking amount WILL NOT BE GIVEN BACK on time, probably never. You need to follow up a million times. I've completely lost trust in this brand! Aggressive sales team that will do any thing to retain you, but the same rigor is not there from the refunds team. How do you expect people to refer casa grand?? Every penny is hard earned money. Please respect that!"
RR370001,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"Visited the project. Worst quality of construction and material selection. In final finish they might hide all these deficiencies. Lot of promises but nothing delivered, everything remains in their fancy marketing videos. Delayed by 1 year now, still lot of work pending. Expect a lot of issues post hand over"
RR370002,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"When I was booking the flat at royce I was shown fake model flats which is shiny false marketing gimmick. What I got in the end 1. Bad Quality - cracks around the house, which keep showing up even after attending them multiple times. 2. 14 sqft less in carpet area than agreement, when I got it checked from 3rd party. it was less than that was mentioned in agreement. I mailed the so called CRM team with no response. Crm team does money collection work mainly , not bothered abt customer relationship. They stop picking calls once you start showing your dissatisfaction. 3. No delay charges paid, there was a 6 months delay from rera date when I asked for compensation at same interest ji rate they are charging, the CRM threatened that it will delay your registration . 4. Have you heard of builder not providing kitchen slab because it‚Äôs out of stock. Then promise to compensate it with a minimal amount. Expect the customer to chase for that amount. After the review - Cracks have been attended by the i-care team. However, the team had promised me a week to solve all issues. Yet no update on other issues listed above."
RR370003,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,Mr.Revanth of Delight team was very helpful in the handover process Truly professional
RR370004,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"Poor experience overall. We got continuously reached out by the marketing team and clearly had specified a 3bhk with a higher floor as our need. We were told while 3 BHKs were sold out, there are several 2&1 bhks on the floor available where the wall could be removed. We after a lot of hesitation went to visit today and it was beyond pathetic. Firstly we were told that the 2+1 arrangement which was told to us as possible was not possible and secondly they said only ground floor 4bhk is available. None of this met our requirements which were clearly stated. The person showing us the sample flat today couldn‚Äôt even explain why is this a wellness focused project and said they have ‚Äúmosquito racquets‚Äù now how does that define wellness is beyond me. Not to mention he tried to sell a 2bhk with a balcony as 2.5bhk trying to say the the balcony is .5. Extremely disappointing"
RR370005,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"Bad Customer Experience with Casa Project in Bangalore. Really I recommend not to buy flats from Casa grand. First thing their sales manager & CRM bluff a lot about the project, but post booking the property they will not stand on their own words which was promise to customer while booking. Also, i had very bad experience that they had changed the layout of private terrace area ( brochure had some different plan) without taking consent from the customer and after approaching to CRM team, they just lift their hand and said nothing can be done. If we cancel the property then need to pay 10 % deduction amount + no refund of GST amount. Also, if we raise any issue related to electric point, design etc which is not as per the approved plan/changes then CTM team will just assure you to fix/escalate till the possession time and at the end will not do anything. Customer have no choice but accept the flat with what CG want as 95% payment is already done. Last point, if you delayed the payment then liable to pay penalty, but if they did delay in possession then no penalty for them. I have a lot to share but not possible to write everything. Note: I would not say overall construction quality is bad, but the journey from booking the property till possession is stressful."
RR370006,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,Yesterday I saw this project in launch event. I glad to say this is very luxury project in affordable price. Project located at main area and well greenery environment .
RR370007,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,This is a low grade builder. Never trust their marketing team. They knows only marketing. On ground reality is zero or poor. Their Chennai projects caught my attention and booked in Casagrand Royce and can share my feedback on it: Project delayed by almost 1 year they get extension from RERA and never pay any penalty for delay handover on the top of that you will be liable to pay all penalties if any. Require at-least 10-12 followups with CRM to get any information. They never respond. Everywhere in washrooms you will feel a bed smell as their architecture of plumbing is poor. You will be forced to keep washrooms closed for 24 hours as u never know when this smell attacks you. You will find good amount of cracks in new building which needs to be corrected in many units or never corrected. Electrician doesn't know how to fix the faults. They are still trying to fix my power trip issue since 4 months. Seepage issues are quite normal. Car parking basement construction is of poor quality and will reduce the life of ur vehicle atleast 3-4 years. I lost shine of my car in 4 months only. Common pathway tiles/flooring looks atleast 10 years old due to scratches they marked during construction. Additionally in previous comments I can see they have asked to write to icare. Unfortunately that is of no use. You write they respond like a common customer care and you will hardly get any resolution. I will say best of luck if you are planning to buy.
RR370008,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,i had booked unit K305 at casagrand Boulevard. after loan sanction and disbursement of two installments the bank started charging pre emi and the project got delayed by a year. I mailed them and they said we will get the loan transfered which did not happen. Now after a year they say either you give cancellation amount of 11 laks or swipe the unit and pay new rate. They have given me no intimation of cancellation nor about the charges. This is pure cheating allotting without NOC from bank or client . after using my funds for a year they have put me in this situation. There was absolutely no response on mail nor my countless visits to their office in ulsoor. I hope the management takes up my issue and does justice.
RR370009,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"Terribly upset with Casagrand Boulevard timeline. Project supposed to complete by November 2023, no response as to when they will be able to complete the project. No one responds to emails and calls. They don't provide compensation for the delay."
RR370010,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,Very super it is located in main road Peacefully environment to stay
RR370011,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"My initial impression was good. But after booking, i came to know about many short fall. Quality of the flat and look wise is OK. But response of CRM team is very poor. They delayed delivery almost 1 year, but did not gave any compensation stating RERA extension reason. They did not informed or discussed with us before applying for extension. But from us, they took huge fine even for few days delay. Not sure how they calculated the fine. So be careful and take everything in writing and follow with them when in doubt."
RR370012,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"Once you fall into their trap, remove the word peaceful from your dictionary. They don't have proper approval for the Private terrace area, High chances of not getting OC Only why they can get occupation certificate is just by bribing officials, and same thing will get revoked by Court Example: Casagrand Lorenza Warning Update: Don;t get trapped by this guys, be very very careful before signing deal"
RR370013,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"We have purchased a flat with Casa and I can definetly say that I am unhappy. You get sweet talked into the project and once you make your decision thinking they are a reputed builder, all you get is faux lies. They leave you hanging with no proper communication channel for anything. When we reached out regarding the delay , the response from the ""SO CALLED CRMs"" is ""Be glad that the project is not delayed for 3 or 5 years"". I was dumbfounded by this unprofessional response. If you are thinking that they are reputed builders and you will get proper response, trust me YOU WON'T. All they care about is selling up their properties and move on to other projects while you are running behind them just to make them listen to your problems. 1. Seepage 2. Cracks 3. Improper STP implementation 4. Substandard Quality of construction 5. No proper Paint Finish Even major fire accident happened due to sub standard electrical equipment. For these basic issues they gave us a run for our money. As a already disappointed resident and customer of Casa, my sincere advice to others is think before you even consider buying a property from them. PS : Don't believe the fake 5 star reviews. Best way to verify is with their existing customers in Bangalore."
RR370014,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"We had a wonderful experience with casagrand group.special thanks to Ms.Salini S from sales team who is very particular in fulfilling the needs of customers and always there to help us when whe enquire something.Also wants to thank Mr.Sriram ,the engineer for his wonderful effort. The property is equipped with quality fittings and there is proper lighting and ventilation too."
RR370015,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"Very unprofessional, unethical builder. When we booked apartment they promised 100% refund, immediately with no questions asked.. But when we canceled booking they made us wait n wait for more than 90days. Sales and CRM will not receive calls. Boardline numbers were not answered. Please scroll down and see many customers have faced same problem. Builder is just replying with template message which proves the point."
RR370016,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,Casagrand Boulevard construction in full swing. Beautiful Project.
RR370017,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,Very worst company I never seen such an worst company in my life very horrible experience
RR370018,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,I would like to Thanks the entire team for working in such a coordination and with in a very humanitarian manner. We never felt any bad incident or rude behaviour since i booked and the reason for cancelling then for refunding the complete amount. A Special thanks to Mohammad Faraz for guiding us throughout the process extremely professional.
RR370019,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"I‚Äôm really not into these reviews writings , but having Surprised to see the rating, I really wanted to help the buyers with genuine issues you may face. I being an existing customer of Casagrand have been facing major concerns and issues which questions the liveability in the flat. please don‚Äôt fall for these high ratings. Before you buy a flat with Casagrand please do reach to any owners in Casagrand Royce and do ask their concerns, you might really rethink on your investment."
RR370020,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"Cons : 1. The smell and noise from the STP is making me unliveable in the flat. They have been trying to fix it for about an year but no use, it really questions their engineering capabilities. 2. Tenants have learnt about the STP problems and none of them are turning up and resale is a nightmare with the STP issue, the resale is never possible. 3. Seepage issues had been a very constant problem for many flats. 4. Insecure balcony designs, One can easily get into your balcony from the higher floors balcony with ease. 5. Ground floor units get a Name sake private terrace, there is hardly any privacy there and we are not allowed to do anything to regain our privacy. 6. The fourth floor flats have seen water seepage through the ceiling, such a shame on the construction quality. 7. Horrible parking slot allocation and some of the flats including mine, the parking slots entry is really too narrow and hardly a SUV can fit in their Pros: Doesn‚Äôt matter , with all these issues that really questions the liveability, I‚Äôm least bothered about your pros. Suggestion: If you are planning to purchase a flat with CG? Do rethink, reach to any owners of CG Royce and check their feedback, don‚Äôt fall for these high ratings If you really want to purchase for their brand name: - Do check on the STP placement, - Do check on the WTP placement - Do check on any amenities that is close to your flat and those that have constant noise and disturbance. - Check for any pillars in and around your parking slot which can avoid accommodating a SUV If you have already purchased: You may have to fight for everything after paying a bomb of a price."
RR370021,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"I agree the location of project is very good and no doubt a good builder. But please get ready for a bumpy ride once you get in to the project by the CRM & project team. The moment you are onboarded you will see the dark side of them. Spend some time in collecting views from existing CG project/visit any of their project in Bengaluru. One of the worst CRM/project team they have. They will never meet the timeline, very occasionally will respond to emails/answer to your call. All they will say is will get it done but timeline is indefinite. No proper escalation matrix in place, even if it is there no one takes the ownership. The higher management never bother to look in to these issues and they are like least bothered about customer service, their focus is only on revenue. I have changed my rating now to 1star because of their who cares attitude. They simply reply call us back, but no response. This is simply disrespectful customer service."
RR370022,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"Brought a flat from this builder, Quality of construction is very poor.By showing amenities they are fooling customers which will be adequate finally. Sharing my experiences with this builder. 1. Till 95% payment construction will be on full swing later it will get delay for 2 years..with that much delay also they have a tag line of on time delivery. 2.Sales time will give lot of false commitments and promises dont belive finaly you will get a different one which is neither in broucher nor in plan. 3.Seepage will be common for all floors 4. For registration be ready to pay bribe. 5.They will wash their hands without out completion if any new project starts, wont get reply from sales project and CRM team."
RR370023,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"Before buying any property from Casagrand builder, have a look on the Royce project quality. Quality is very poor with leakages and frequent repairs. Raised ICARE tickets regarding the issues, from 6 months i am following up no response"
RR370024,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"Poor and cheap quality builder. The construction of work is contracted to 3 rd party.. Don't fall in trap of casagrand. I own there apartment in bangalore and it's not worth the money we spend. Life will became nightmare 1 Full of seepage, 2 all amenities will have outdated second hand products. 3 - there was major fire accident due to poor quality of electrical box used.. 4 poor CRM 5 poor project team.. All the engineers will be just passed out interns.."
RR370025,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"This is low quality builder, they try to hype project with marketing but no proper planning on ground, within one year of construction cracks will appear in building also no proper planning it utility and amenities, they will promise big brands for indoors but actual agreement will have term equivalent and you get that. I have bought apartment in there ROYCE project thinking there Chennai reputation but it's in vain, but it's like whatever shines it's not gold There is no on time delivery, no proper follow up on issue and once you start staying you will face a new issue everyday So best luck if you buy..."
RR370026,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"Before going with Casagrand Bangalore plots, I would suggest you to visit their Royce site for a better picture on the quality of how they have delivered. Only the sales team would do their best to make you buy the site. They would compare themselves with Brigade and Prestige but at the end what I have recieved is the worst quality delivered. This is far more worst than a local builders quality. Dont go by the launch at the end what you recieve is way more worst. Edit: Below are the pictures from my house which they have been working for the past 3 years and havent got a chance to fix the seepage until now which they know is their problem"
RR370027,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"I had purchased apartment in Royce, the construction quality is very bad with no oversight by site engineers. Seepages and cracks everywhere, even the exit gate has broken down 5 times in less than 6 months. Design flaws can be seen at every corner. They promise you heat resistant tiles on terrace, leave alone delivering it, the finishing of terrace is pathetic. They will violate the terms and conditions at their whims and fancies, they didn't provide things promised in brochure. We are yet to get Cauvery connection even after confirmation from Casa team in written. If you want to see real feedback please visit Royce. Also all the 5 star ratings are fake given by Casa Employees."
RR370028,1 Year,Casagrand Boulevard,"I am an Owner of CG built property in Bangalore. I had selected CG based on the brand equity they enjoyed in Chennai market. However the Bangalore chapter of CG is a complete different story as per my experience; So DONT INVEST IN CG JUST BY BASING ON CHENNAI MARKET GOODWILL. CG Bangalore has a very strong marketing and sales team. But beyond that they are a bag of lies and false promises. At the time of buying the unit, the marketing team made promises of making certain modifications to my unit. Vinitha from Marketing team was the POC. She got a ""so-called"" approval from then Project lead Mr Nagireddi. Thankfully I had it documented . Refer to Pic 1 ( Snapshot of approval mail from Nagireddy). Keeping up the ruse, the CRM team also got the modification included in the Modification plan prepared by Sandeep ( Site engineer from CG). Refer to Pic 2 where the modifications highlighted. Then after almost 1 year, when all payments till then were made. the CRM team sends me a mail saying that they cannot do that modification. Refer to Pic 3 ( mail from Sneha ). Such is the brand equity of CG that they made me buy an unit based on false promises which they were sure that they will not keep. Bangalore CRM team lead Sheena , supported by Prathap are equally trained to mislead the customers and maintaining the false promises. I have never interacted with a more unethical team of professionals. So during buying stage, if you get any promises from the Marketing or the CRM team, do not trust them. Get everything documented and verify the legality of the promises independently. Specially be aware of the CRM Sheena. Now comes the execution or the delivery part by the Site Engineers or Project team. DO NOT TRUST WHAT IS MENTIONED IN BOULEVARD BROCHURE. Check if that is mentioned in the Sale Deed. CG promised lot of features in our Royce Brochure ; however many were not delivered citing that it was never mentioned in Sale Deed. CG Bangalore has proved to be encouraging unethical practices like this. Definitely compare Sale Deed particulars with Features mentioned in Brochure. THIS IS A MUST FOR NEW BUYERS. There are outstanding issues at the overall Project level which CG has not yet addressed even when they are about to exit Royce Maintanence (of 6 months approx). Examples - No clarity being provided by CG Bangalore on Cauvery connection even though they have collected fees for that, STP issues , etc. At an INDIVIDUAL level, post delivery I have observed multiple air cracks in my unit , impacting all rooms in my unit. Within 3-4 months, cracks appeared on Door frames, Main door lock stopped functioning properly etc. In short, DO NOT TRUST CG BANGALORE TEAM. Only off late Customer Delight team from Chennai started interacting with us, but breakthoughs on serious matters are yet to happen. Only Promises are what we see still now."

RR370035,1 Year ,Casagrand Boulevard,It's been 5 days since i'm trying to contact sales team of Casagrand Boulevard but couldn't after multiple enquiry. Looks like the feedback given on google is write about casagrand team. And now by seeing activeness of sales team i doubt if i invest in this project then will get handover of my flat on projected date. Very disappointed with your service.
RR370036,2 Years ,Casagrand Boulevard,Nice property. We have purchased in Luxus with interior plan. Very supportive sales team they have helped us till the Handover.and planning to take one more Flat in casagrand for investment. Thank you casagrand for helping us to get our dream house.
RR370037,3 Years ,Casagrand Boulevard,Casagrand is a no.1 fraud builder in the market.please don't get cheated by sales team. Sales team and CRM team are big liars. Please go through the reviews of owners who are suffering now. Those who gave 4 and 5 star reviews are casagrand employees and paid people.
RR370038,1 Year ,Casagrand Boulevard,"Please note this property Casagrand boulevard has its own issues, the proposed peripheral ring road is falling just outside the property, one can guess what would happen to this property if the pillars are right in front of this property entrance. Moreover some of the amenities will be eaten up by the ring road project. Casagrand customer care is pathetic. Donot buy it."
RR370039,3 Years ,Casagrand Boulevard,"Hi All prospective buyers of Casagrand Boulevard, I bought a 3BHK in Casagrand Royce and I would like to share my experience and why I would rate them 1 STAR. 1. SENSOR BEAMS: In CASAGRAND ROYCE Brochure they wrote they will install ""SENSOR BEAMS"" across the compound wall to avoid intrusion. But actually they just installed flimsy 2 feet barbed wire which already started falling down at many places. When we questioned they told we didn't mention that we will provide sensor beams in SALE AGREEMENT so we are not liable to provide it. So don't believe what they write in brochure. 2. Utility Grills: At ROYCE kitchen utilities have vertical metal bars, the quality of METAL BARS what they shown in demo house is far superior than what they actually installed. Bottom line: They should strive hard to maintain their credibility. Such outright elusive behavior is not right."
RR370040,>3 Years ,Casagrand Boulevard,I have purchased a site in Royce two year back and got possession last year. At the time of sales they told they will provide Cauvery water and it‚Äôs been one year they didn‚Äôt even paid to Karnataka govt to provide Cauvery connection toRoyce. Their 6month maintenance period is over now they are trying to leave the project without providing Cauvery connection to Royce. Never believe their sales team word and they are very good in cheating customer. Do not waste your hard earn money by investing in CG proj. We Royce ppl struggling to get each thing mentioned during sales time. Think before investing in Royce. Prob we are facing even after one year of possession 1. Cauvery water 2. Poor STP construction 3. Seepage on many places 4. Poor basement floor work where u will see lot of cement mixture coming out. 5. No proper handover to form association Think think think before you invest with them
RR370041,>3 Years ,Casagrand Boulevard,"I faced somany issues buying a flat in a casagrand . Everytime you will get some surprises from builder... After booking the appartment to till handover.... Like UDS, modification charges, project will not handover ontime( builder will not handover project on time they will get RERA Approval), late payment charges, you will find somany snags during inspection you will getshocked... i faced major issues Tiles Halloween..... I didn't get any proper response from higher management especially Alex and CRM team... Don't buy flat just by seeing model flat and advertisement.... In model flat quility will be good but they will demolish it 6 months or before handovering your flat to you... So you don't not have any proof to compare the quality . I will suggest middle class people to think once again before buying your dream house in casagrand.

RR316303,1 Year ,Marathon Neoskies,"Very bad experience. Unprofessional and chip builder.
I have purchased flat in marathon neo skies. As per the rera the project end date was December 2023 but I have not received possession yet.
I have already paid my all dues once I received my final demand letter but marathon is not giving me possession because they have set up their office in my flat and they want to use that until the project is over and even they are not providing any compensation for delay.

Do not buy flats in Marathon. Very bad customer support. They never receive my calls. Worst experience.

Check photos of my flat even after paying all the payments related to possession.

If you don't want your dream home to be used by a builder then look for the better builder and not marathon."
RR316304,3 Years ,Marathon Neoskies,Yesterday I have again inspected Neo skies B wing 802 flat. But the conditions is very bad.living room glass was not available. Bathroom tiles are damaged. Geyser is missing. Kitchen platform is not as per sample flat. The area of sample flat and actual flat is totally different. As per my calculations the carpet area is 269 sq ft only but in agreement it is 323 sq ft. We have to check this. My agreement is 2019 dated as per agreement my possession date is 31/12/2022 but till date they have not given possession. I paid full payment. Now they are not responding to emails and what‚Äôs up. Now I have decided not to follow up builder. We have rera acts for home buyers. Today I have started compliant about builder for not giving possession on time. As per rera we can ask full amount with interest on delayed months. Or we can ask 10% interest on total flat cost.also you file a complaint in consumer court. And rera both. Henceforth builder should think before giving false commitments
RR316305,>3 Years ,Marathon Neoskies,"If there was a rating lesser than 1star, I would have used one to review this project. After thoughtful consideration, I am writing this review for the potential buyers planning to invest in Marathon projects.
I made an investment in the project in the year 2021 going by the project‚Äôs and the builder‚Äôs reputation.
The Committed possession timeline was Dec 2023. Let alone the possession of the property, there was no official communication of the delay in the handover.
After continuous followups, multiple visits and lots of to and fro I was handed over the property on 25 May 2024 with no water supply and electricity connection. I was requested to wait for couple more days after the possession to have the water supply and electricity enabled which obviously did not happen until another week.
Please note while signing the possession letter, I was told all the observation's identified during inspection has already been fixed,
Water supply and electricity is enabled but obviously that was not the case when the property was Handedover on 25th May 2024.
After the possession, there was leekages in washbasin area, drainage blockages which I had to get it coordinated with facility team myself.Trust me the process was no less than a nightmare.
I thought my case was exceptional, however I realised everybody who has invested in the project has encountered similar issues.
I am attaching the pictures for a clear-view of the quality which is been delivered under the premise of the brand value we were promised of.
Coming to the society premises, there is still flooring work going on in the lower floors, lobby, terrace. Amenities for which they have started charging us in the maintenance cost doesn‚Äôt exist.
We have been made to sign a consent letter/ no objection letter that the construction work will continue to happen till Dec 2024 while they have made us complete the possession process by an email confirmation of project completion by Jun 2024. While I want to be optimistic about the committed timelines, I am equally hopeless about any services or completion of the project in the near future.
I am attaching the project images when the flats has already been handed over for the reference."
RR316306,>3 Years ,Marathon Neoskies,"They fool us.the colour of bui lding look like municipal school.the flat was uncomfortable to stay.
The builder shows a sample flat is good but really we are not happu to stay in originally build up the flats.
I will not recommend to others to purchase a flat from marathon builders.
Congested kitchen."
RR316307,>3 Years ,Marathon Neoskies,"We have received the flat but the main door is having a fault .so I am trying to contact the concern person ,but he is not receiving my call and neglecting .I find very bad response from Marathon neoskies .There is problem in painting work in the bedroom also no proper touch up is also done after repeated telling."
RR316308,>3 Years ,Marathon Neoskies,"Marathon of a Saga

We booked two apartments in Marathon Neoskies in 2021, with the agreement stating a delivery date of June 30, 2023. However, we have yet to receive possession of either flat. In the initial months, follow-ups were met with false assurances. In February 2024, upon inquiry, they claimed to have applied for the OC in December 2023, blaming the delay on authorities. But the reality was starkly different‚Äîthe project was nowhere near completion and certainly uninhabitable. The updates posted by the builder‚Äôs engineer on the RERA site clearly reflected this. It was clear they had no qualms about misleading their customers.

The builder eventually obtained a part OC in early May 2024 and immediately sent a final demand letter, asking for the last payment within 15 days. When I delayed my payment by just three days, they promptly charged me interest. But when I asked about the interest they owed me for the delayed possession, as per RERA guidelines and the agreement, their customer representatives, with a smug smile, said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have any provision for paying delay interest.‚Äù Left with no other option, I had to take the matter to court to assert my rights.

Then came the time for the apartment inspections. To my disappointment, both apartments were in terrible condition. Water leaks from multiple taps, and the common bathroom wall was broken in one place due to a concealed pipe joint pouring water.

Finally, when they called me for possession, they handed me a possession letter along with a unilateral undertaking, that was entirely in favor of the builder. It required me to waive any claims for delay, grant the builder full control over various matters, and absolve him of any future responsibility. I consulted my lawyer, who confirmed that the declaration was illegal. I signed the possession letter and refused to sign undertaking, but the builder is adamant‚Äîno possession until I sign the undertaking.

I‚Äôm not sure if a common person like me can win against such a powerful builder, but I‚Äôve decided to fight. I still believe that in our country, the law stands above even the mightiest of builders.

Be careful before you make any deals with such builders.

Jai Hind!"
RR316309,>3 Years ,Marathon Neoskies,"I booked a flat and got possession on June 22 after a six-month delay. I had been pressuring Marathon to give me possession. At the time of signing the possession letter, they also gave us a consent letter to sign. It stated that we, the customers, were aware of the project's delay and were in favor of it because we had previously stayed in a rental home, and our rent agreement expired in February 2024. We had no other option and needed possession early. Marathon said if we didn't sign the consent letter, they wouldn't give us possession. This is ethically wrong; Marathon is bullying their customers."
RR316310,1 Year ,Marathon Neoskies,"Absolutely atrocious experience with Marathon Neo Skies and its deceitful practices. I had the misfortune of booking Flat No. 2202, 1 BHK in A wing, and this builder has been nothing short of a nightmare from start to finish.

Initially, I paid a token amount of 50k, only to be relentlessly badgered just 3 days later for a booking amount of 4.5 lakhs. They sweet-talked about fast-tracking my home loan approval once I submitted my documents, but for 4 agonizing months, they did nothing but waste my time and hold onto my hard-earned money.

Finally fed up after 5 months of empty promises, I decided to cancel my purchase. Little did I know, Marathon Neo Skies conveniently revealed their steep cancellation charges at this juncture, conveniently omitted during the sales pitch. Desperate and in need of my money back, I pleaded with them in writing to waive these exorbitant fees.

But the saga continued. I waited an additional 3 months for a refund, only to discover they deducted a staggering 3% of the total flat cost‚Äîapproximately 1.7 lakhs! This amount is a crushing blow to someone in my financial position.

Marathon Neo Skies is not just a builder but a scam artist of the highest order. Their unethical behavior, lack of transparency, and callous disregard for their customers' financial well-being are despicable. Karma will surely catch up with these fraudsters who prey on innocent homebuyers.

I strongly caution anyone considering purchasing from Marathon Neo Skies to beware. They will drain your savings, waste your time, and leave you in a financial mess without batting an eye. Steer clear and choose a builder who values honesty and customer service over profit margins."
RR316311,1 Year ,Marathon Neoskies,"Marathon Neo Skies crew and Suyog Developers
Both the wait for our apartment and your reply have really disappointed me. After telling us that an OC has been received and that 100% payment has been collected, you have yet to confirm the inspection date. What are problems? For the customers, it truly is harassment.
Since December, we have suffered several losses such as rent and home loan interest. But you don't care about the customer's difficulties. I think you are playing with customers feeling and emotions. This is not acceptable at all"
RR316312,2 Years ,Marathon Neoskies,"As per agreement the original date of possession was December 2023 still marathon didn‚Äôt received OC.

I had a very bad experience with respect to customer service no one responses to call and email.
This type of service and response from Marathon is unacceptable.

If we would have delayed payments marathon would have charged interest from us and now they can easily run away from this by showing some RERA Clauses and avoid paying interest to customers.

We don‚Äôt want to hear any excuses and need possession in first week of May 2024.

Consider it as top priority and take action."
RR316313,3 Years ,Marathon Neoskies,As per the RERA page the proposed date of completion is 30th Dec 2023 but still not received possession (today date Feb 2024) neither allowed to visit the place given we have already paid more than 90% of the construction. This should be address by marathon management to convey further timelines about marathon Neoskies. Atleast allow there flat owners to visit there flat which should be there right.

RR13940,1 Year,Raheja Reflections Eternity,"Very pretty from the outside, but some basic infrastructure issues:
1. Water is a consistent problem. While the other Rajeha buildings in the compound get water through the day, there are regular and unpredictable water cuts in Eternity. Mainly, bad water planning by the society.
2. Leakage in ceilings of many flats.
3. Society management is super slow in fixing problems.
4. The in-house facility management is really bad. Bad quality plumber and electrician. We end up calling external people.
5. Simple things like giving IDs to the bais takes over a month!
6. Common to all Raheja buildings in the compound - Club house swimming pool is not functional a lot of times. Water turns green."

RR6909,1 Year,Kumar Sophronia,Lots of restrictions for tenants from not allowing guests after 11pm to no food delivery after 12. Your guests are not welcome to stay with you and you are not even permitted to just roam around at night even in the garden area of the society. The society members misbehave and we are told that our very own family members cannot visit us at our place after a certain time of the day. Living has been a very bad experience for me as well my other friends who are tenants here.

RR123420,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,"Only looks good from the outside. Highly commercial and everything is about money making in this society & elected committee. Poor construction, walls are weak, cigarette smoke comes in from other flats into your flat, basement parking gets flooded with sewage water often. During rains water enters rooms from windows as the parapet over the windows are inadequate and they do not permit extending the parapet using fibreglass sheets for an extended roof because the society ""beauty"" will get spoilt while during Deepavali the public road outside the maingate is allowed to be littered by some uncouth PKG residents with firecracker waste, sharp metal wires from sparklers, flower pots etc but then who cares as long as the ""beauty"" inside the apartment is maintained public areas can be ruined. Bathroom flush tanks often get smelly brown water as a result of inefficient/broken/badly maintained STP. Swimming pool is badly maintained and closed many days and smells bad when it is open. There is water rationing:only two hours in the morning and evening. Corrupt security guards don't do their job (delivery partners going to wrong flats late into the night) instead monitor residents' flats and impose unreasonable fines to fill the committees pockets while enough security incidents regarding safety have occurred and the security guards only stand and stare including a recent road rage incident inside where a goon from outside followed a couple smashed their car and tried to assault them in front of 10 security guards who did nothing. The elected committee is unresponsive and corrupt self serving their own and their friends' personal interests, busy making money from loud events, car & bike dealers, renting out the banquet hall for garment sales and flea markets, renting out tennis courts for model commercial shoots while preventing residents to use the facilities. Very high maintainance fees compared to other societies therefore one wonders where does all the ‚Äòadditional‚Äô revenue generated from the elected committees‚Äô initiatives go - committee lacking transparency in money related matters. Children unfriendly society - they don't allow kids skating on the pretext of other residents‚Äô safety while delivery partners overspeed, drive rashly and haphazardly park anywhere on the inner roads. Bad/inexperienced vendors for the upkeep of facilities/clubhouse/gym AC /pool/STP leading to frequent disruptions, vendor selection in not transparent leading to frequent breakage of machinery outages of AC/Filtration systems etc Overall just an overhyped ‚ÄúPrestige‚Äô branded property but not a great place to live if you want safety, peace of mind and comfort."
RR123421,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,The flat only looks beautiful and that's it. There is no water always you would see a water tanker standing at the gate. There are many water disrupts in the flats. The water quality is also bad its smells of drainage. Even the lower floor house have a bad smell always coming. Basically this place has no water. There are lots of dogs in the flat walking around in the premises peeing everywhere. It's not human friendly to walk around as the place always stinking. For prestige this is really bad quality residence.
RR123422,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,"Prestige Kew Gardens offers a serene retreat in bustling Bangalore, with surrounding greenery that creates a peaceful ambiance. The location is ideal, providing easy access to the city's amenities. However, the proximity to the airport means occasional aircraft noise, which could be a concern. Additionally, the distance from public markets might require a bit of travel, but the tranquility and beauty of the surroundings make it a worthwhile trade-off for those seeking a peaceful living environment."

RR123434,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,"One of the best pubs in Bangalore. The music is always loud, the crowd is always energetic. They have special events at least once a month. Whatever the occasion... Sankranti, Pongal, Holi, Christmas, Diwali, it's always just an excuse for a party ;) To hell with boring traditional music, the mood is always club, with favourites like Appadi pode and Lungi dance! The best part is they don't give a damn about complaints from neighbours, sound pollution, civic spirit, or any of that boring nonsense. So you can party here as long as you want, no problem! The party always goes on, day or night!"
RR123435,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,"Sharing this review out of angst for this particular society. The buildings practically look into each other's windows and apartments with significant issues with privacy. The mobile connectivity isn't great either with almost zero connectivity towards the end of the society. Of course, the rentals are overpriced for this area considering you have to go at least 3-4 Kms before you land up near civilization."

RR123448,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,"Very good atmosphere for hassle free living. Amenities like swimming pool, tennis, basketball, badminton, squash, pool game, table tennis courts, reading and card room facilities, indoor gym and yoga hall, mini convention hall are available. Well maintained."
RR123449,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,"Flats at gated community. A clean environment in Bangalore city. Gym , swimming pool and beautiful garden for children with play area. Well maintained tennis court and basketball court are available. One drawback is noise from flights that land and take off from HAL airport. Ample car parking is available."
RR123450,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,"Beautifully landscaped and well planned. It has a dog park, walking track, lawns, swimming pool, a massive clubhouse that has badminton, tennis, sauna, gym, a movie theater, two banquets and more. Five star property."
RR123451,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,"I visited few days ago, one of my friend stay there with his family. I found it is very organized and systematic since while entering at gate I had to share all my details and after taking permission from owner the security would allow anybody inside. So I waited for sometime and finally I was allowed and went inside and got to chance to see, it is really beautiful "
RR123452,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,The location is really good. Sound proofing is missing completely. builder designed septic tank very poorly and therefore it mixes up with regular water as well.
RR123453,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,"Lots of greenery in the campus; the buildings are built congested. Rooms in the apartments are small, except the master bedroom. Common toilet in the apartment was too small."
RR123454,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,"One of the most homely abodes I have ever visited, felt more like a township than an apartment complex. An Ideal place to raise a family."
RR123455,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,good place to take a flat. But one problem there is a old airport just next to this property. And the port is used for testing which sometime create lot of noise.
RR123456,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,"It has a Very cosy and natural atmosphere, it has all types of amenities and a clubhouse. Has a grocery store inside"
RR123457,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,Good clean and safe place for individuals and families. Well maintained and well organised facilities.
RR123458,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,"Revised to a 2 Star as the builder has addressed many of the issues over time. While the 1BHK design has a few major misses (electric layout, space optimisation) and construction quality (flush doors, masonry) could be better, the team has ensured that day-to-day requirements are met. In addition, very few modifications are approved so you have to go with the layout provided. However, given the limited amount of free space (given the horizontal spread of the property due to height restrictions in the vicinity of HAL), this does not feel like a typical Prestige property. If you are considering buying a property to occupy (rather than as an investment), especially the 1BHK, you should really think through. You are likely to find a much better quality of life at the same price elsewhere. The whole concept of mixing 1 BHKs with 2-3 BHKs without providing adequate amenities to address the different needs/interests of a wider group is a shortcoming that Prestige needs to think through for their newer projects too. 1 Star (Aug 2020): The property is beautiful but many aspects of the project/process are poorly managed by the builder. Handover was delayed significantly and in spite of the delay, the builder seems to have made scant effort to get things right. Planning and transparency are lacking. Except for 1-2 exceptional staff , interaction with the broader team leaves one exasperated. As a large complex of 950+ units, problems are bound to happen but a good organisation would address these quickly, conclusively and sustainably. This is in stark contrast to some of the other builders like Shriram, Bren, whose projects in the vicinity were in my shortlist. The premium that this project comes at, for 1 BHK, is hard to justify given the standard of delivery. Be it design (especially, for the 1BHK), construction quality or service, the project leaves a lot to be desired."
RR123459,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,"a nice place. surroundings are not so good, but when you enter you feel secured and safe. good society with ample facilities."
RR123460,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,"Safe n secure, good ambience with all the necessary amenities, well maintained gardens,etc it was a pleasant experience overall."
RR123461,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,"It is one of biggest societies in Yemalur area, with lot of open area within the society. Still the residents and management choose to celebrate Diwali fireworks and Lohri fire on the main road, making it extremely unsafe for people travelling on the main road"
RR123462,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,"An oasis in the centre of Bengaluru. Spread over 16 acres, it's standing tall on its promise of greenery, approachability, city centre etc. Believe would be a much sought after project in times to come."
RR123463,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,"Helping security. Nicely landacaped and individual towers are not tall..., Nice CH. The driveway is a bit small at some places and to the parking."
RR123464,1 Year,Prestige Kew Gardens,"I have visited this place few weeks ago, location not that much great. I want to mention few more prestige projects sales executive behavior, very pathetic experience, I don't know how they're selling flat with these kind of people. Giving a reference of water mistry sales near hebbal, No welcoming to the customer or not even ready to talk. This same behavior in all of their project whoever I met for flat enquiry."

RR1187,1 Year,Prestige Park View,"Extremely well maintained society that I had the privilege to stay in for a couple of years. Great jogging track, well maintained green spaces and plenty of options for kids. Great clubhouse as well, which feels premium and exotic. The traffic outside (Hope Farm Junction) is definitely a bummer. The shop in the society could be better maintain led, but it has a decent amount of necessities and groceries. Expensive, but worth it. Please feel free to give me a üëçüèª and a follow if this helped üòä"
RR1188,1 Year,Prestige Park View,Good society near hope farm. The reception is spacious than any great office in Bangalore. The rent is very very unnecessarily high even after 3 year of COVID era.

RR1195,1 Year,Prestige Park View,"Society and flats are good with professional maintenance but biggest bummer is 24*7 noise due to traffic on hope farm junction and metro track.

RR1199,1 Year,Prestige Park View,"The only good thing in this society is grand entrance to the building. That's it. The quality of construction is really really bad and Pathetic. Though the maintenance is high, there is no proper place for kids to play and very little club house facility as compared with other societies having same maintenance. Much hyped rent. Its not at all value for money. The above comments are purely based on 2 years of stay."

R38794,1 Year,Gaur Heights,"Living in Gaur Heights: A Perfect Blend of Connectivity and Serenity
Having lived in Gaur Heights for 11 years, I have explored many societies across Vaishali and NCR. What sets Gaur Heights apart is its strategic location and peaceful environment, offering an ideal mix of connectivity and tranquillity.

Prime Location with Excellent Connectivity
One of Gaur Heights' biggest advantages is its proximity to key locations. Vaishali Metro Station is just 200 meters from the back gate, ensuring seamless connectivity to Delhi and NCR. Similarly, Sector 4 Market, major banks, ATMs, and daily-need utilities are within 200 meters of the front gate.

Despite being close to essential services, Gaur Heights is slightly tucked away from the main roads of Sector 4 and Sector 5, ensuring a quieter living experience free from constant traffic noise. The atmosphere has a South Delhi-like vibe‚Äîcalm, yet well-connected.

Spacious & Well-Designed Apartments
Gaur Heights consists of two towers, Tower A and Tower B, catering to different lifestyles.

Tower A: Features luxurious and big size bedrooms and living room flats with 100-125 sq. ft. balconies and a low loading area (below 20%), ensuring more usable space. A key highlight is the 10-ft wide, 100-ft long corridor, a rare feature in NCR societies. All flats receive ample natural light and ventilation.

Tower B: Designed for affordability without compromising space. Apartments have thoughtful layouts, scenic balconies, and well-designed interiors. Even three-bedroom flats offer ample space for families. All flats receive ample natural light and ventilation.

Every apartment maximizes space, ensures proper ventilation, and provides abundant natural light‚Äîfeatures not easily found in other societies.

Premium Amenities for a Quality Lifestyle
Unlike many societies, Gaur Heights offers world-class amenities, all included in the monthly maintenance charges:

‚úÖ Modern Gym with up-to-date equipment
‚úÖ Small Library for book lovers
‚úÖ Swimming Pool for relaxation
‚úÖ Air-conditioned Senior Citizen Hall & Library
‚úÖ Spacious Common Hall (accommodates 150+ guests)
‚úÖ Multi-purpose Sports Area (30x60 feet) for volleyball, cricket, and football, secured with an iron-net wall
‚úÖ Dedicated Kids' Play Zone for children below 10 years

These facilities create a vibrant, active, and community-driven lifestyle for all residents.

Affordable Maintenance & Secure Living
Gaur Heights is known for its low maintenance charges, making it one of Vaishali‚Äôs most cost-effective choices. A 1270 sq. ft. flat pays only Rs. 4200 per month, with no additional club fees.

Security remains a priority, with 24/7 personnel and CCTV surveillance ensuring a safe living environment. The walkways between both towers provide a peaceful space for residents to walk, socialize, and unwind.

Ongoing Upgrades & Improvements
Like any residential complex, Gaur Heights has faced a few challenges:
üîπ Aging Lifts
üîπ Leakage Issues in Shafts

The Residents‚Äô Association launched a proactive renovation campaign in January 2024 to address these concerns. Residents contribute Rs. 2000 per month for 36 months to fund these upgrades.

‚úî 90% of leakage issues resolved
‚úî Over 50% of shaft pipes replaced
‚úî One lift per tower to be replaced soon, with the rest scheduled within a year
‚úî Repainting of Tower B is underway, with Tower A next in line

This ensures Gaur Heights continues to evolve, offering an even better living experience.

Final Thoughts: A Place That Feels Like Home
Gaur Heights offers the perfect blend of location, amenities, and affordability. Whether you're a working professional, a family, or a senior citizen, this society provides a well-rounded lifestyle‚Äîpeaceful, well-connected, and packed with great facilities.

With ongoing enhancements and a thriving community, Gaur Heights remains one of the best residential choices in Vaishali."
R38795,1 Year,Gaur Heights,"Very very spacious rooms which you won‚Äôt find anywhere in NCR I can bet that. Market, Hospital , Malls & Restaurants as well as metro station all are at walking distance.Interiors of flats is of premium quality. Social Harmony at its best as society celebrates all festivals with a zeal & Love. So what else are you waiting for?? Go and grad it."
R38796,>3 Years,Gaur Heights,"The society is very well located, Vaishali Metro is 200 meters away which makes it very commutable. Society is close to Max Vaishali and Yashoda hospital. Rooms are very spacious and big with all the amenities. Builder loading is not more than 10%, while the norm is 35% to 40 % elsewhere. Definately worth a try."
R38797,1 Year,Gaur Heights,"Location‚Ä¶closeness in residents..festival gatherings‚Ä¶isolation in environment(no traffic chaos, noise free surrounding) yet access to market, hospitals, best restaurants nearby are few key USPs of this society

Only shortcoming was much needed repair for seepage, paint etc which is now in process and soon to complete."
R38798,1 Year,Gaur Heights,One of the premium societies of vaishali.It has a swimming pool and a gym.One of the first society to introduce electric vehicle charging facility.It has a pretty responsive RWA.Whats app groups are created for registering complaints and house keeping is also on point with daily updates provided in what's app.Near to metro hospital and sector -4 market.It has one of the biggest 2bhk and 3bhk sizes available among all of the Vaishali societies.The society comes to it's full glory in the night time when the ornamental lights are turned on providing it a luxurious ambience.
R38799,2 years,Gaur Heights,very nice place to stay. People are very co-operative . All the functions held here the very best one in Vaishali . connectivity are the best one. All the amenities are within your reach.

R38801,1 Year,Gaur Heights,"I had to stay on rent in a 2bhk here for 1.5 years. It's a foul smelling, dirty, congested place with very arrogant, nuisance creating owners and maintenance/security teams. Almost every month there was some or the other bad incident happening in this gated community. One can get lured and trapped by it being close to metro/market/mall/other apartments, etc."
R38802,1 Year,Gaur Heights,Best place to live in Vaishali with all facilities nearby and walking distance from Vaishali metro station.
R38803,>3 Years,Gaur Heights,Best Maintenance. Spaceous flats . Quality of construction is strong

R38806,1 Year,Gaur Heights,"Walking Distance from Metro, Mall and Chandra Laxmi hospital"
R38807,>3 Years,Gaur Heights,"It has two towers. Tower A & tower B.
Tower A was purchased by Gaur sons from GDA which was lying unutilized for many years. Originally GDA had made 1, 2 & 3 BHK flats in this tower, who could not find any buyers. After lying vacant for many years in dilapidated condition, GAUR Sons bought it, removed partition walls & converted all flats of whole tower in 2 BHK flats.
Builder constructed tower B in year 2008-09.
Few residents are very arrogant & u can notice dog fight in matters related to RWA.

A property broker living in the Gaur Heights itself is not to be relied. In Oct 2014, he took hefty money from me on loan & till date has not returned single penny. You will end up paying higher price / rent as his motive is only to earn brokerage."

R54112,2 Years,Atul Alcove,"Its a good society. It has all amenities and facilities. But, i felt the flats were conjusted and small. The living area and kitchen are big, but the bedrooms are small and so are the washrooms. The area the society is in great and booming."
R54113,3 Years,Atul Alcove,"I stayed for 1.5 years, Society management is not up to the mark, too many issues with club house, water supply, etc..otherwise infrastructure wise it is a really good and spacious society."

Gym, swimming pool, lot of space to play bandmiton and other sports."
R54115,2 Years,Atul Alcove,Popular residential premises in Pimple Saudagar. Well maintained society. This is a big housing society and looking so attractive. Construction is this place so artificial. Swimming pool and fitness center available here. For kids playing instruments available here. All premises cover CCTV cameras. Security guards available 24 hours.
R54116,3 Years,Atul Alcove,"Pros: Beautiful, airy and green society

Cons: Stupid society management rules like they don't allow furniture & heavy stuff in lifts. They are very emotional about their lifts! don't know why."
R54117,2 Years,Atul Alcove,Very spacious...unlike the cramped...societies you see in this part of the country...currently bachelors allowed..but henceforth chances are they might not be as the owners may disallow...ample parking space...good cross ventlilation.... market areas around for daily needs and mix of both locals and outsiders.
R54118,>3 Years,Atul Alcove,"Located at a prime location, this is a very nice society with a garden and a temple and ample common space to have a walk. Flats in this society are spacious with good balconies showing nice views."
R54119,2 Years,Atul Alcove,"Nice society with required amenities.
Breeze is really lovely for all flats. Nice club house and gym.
Balconies are really great to have.
But,
Lots of water issues , same in all pimple saudagar. Society is not completely cabable to resolve all issues in society. Bulider has not completed parking work and other small work even after years and years of completion of society. To stay its nice society but dont think of buying flat here."
R54120,>3 Years,Atul Alcove,"its a pathatic society having so many problems
1.You cant use service lift for shifting you luggage...
i wonder why they have service lift ???
its a big headache for family person to shift without using lift..
2.Big Big water problem..
if u have family consider this as big problem..
3.More than 100 flats are not having there dedicated parking so open space is always busy..
4.If you are tenant you will never get any information as they dont add you in Society group..
5.Children Park is not in good condition.
6.Visitor parking space is too small..
7.Intercom didnt work..
8.club house hall washroom are not clean & didnt have proper lighting if u plan to book hall for function consider this...

Attitude Problem in management"
R54121,3 Years,Atul Alcove,"Poorly maintained. Only 6 car parking for visitor and if they get over then u cant park.

R54124,2 Years,Atul Alcove,"When I first came to the society, it seemed all good, but from Jan there's no water in taps half the day, no water in the flush the whole day, no intent of giving water through tankers to the residents either. Some to friends in other societies in the same vicinity, and no other society has started cutting water supply as yet, and Alcove is the only one currently. My neighbours are considering leaving the society just for this reason. Atleast you can give water in the flush and the jet the whole day, that's a basic need, not a want. Pathetic way of saving water."
R54125,>3 Years,Atul Alcove,"nice location but its located at place where essentials are not at walking distance, moreover very low public transport frequency (buses) only option is autos. bit they charge randomy i.e. not on meter price may range from 60-150 rs"

R159,2 Years,Emaar Mgf Commonwealth Games Village 2012,"Excellent place to live in Delhi. The complex is huge and adjacent to Axardham. It proximity to Delhi, NOIDA, Ghaziabad makes it a great place. A mart would have made the place more convenient. Axardham metro 1.1 km from the complex make the place convenient to public transport users, too."
R160,2 Years,Emaar Mgf Commonwealth Games Village 2013,"Booked a single AC suite room. It was the worst. 1) Not at all clean. The room was extremely ugly with so much of dirt. 2) AC was not working. When we checked at the reception for another room with AC, they informed that there are no rooms with AC working. 3) The staff behavior was very rude. 4) The check in time was 11:00 am. But, we arrived late by 12:30 p.m. Even then the rooms were not cleaned and ready. We had to wait for them to clean, which was not done properly. 5) The toilets were the worst. Not at all clean. 6) There were no plug points in the room. There is no way you can charge your phones."

R165,>3 Years,Emaar Mgf Commonwealth Games Village 2018,Visited CWG govt guest house . Place was very clean and nice ambience. Nearest metro station is Akshardham metro station. Auto charges 40 to 50 rupees from metro to reach CWG flats.
R166,1 Year,Emaar Mgf Commonwealth Games Village 2019,The place is located on the Meerut expressway Noida Delhi NCR on the NE 9 just across the Yamuna river. Very very calm and clean area with a lot of greenery and adjacent to the famous AKSHARDHAM Mandir. Around 1300 apartments where people stay in a mix of government and private accommodation. Hardly 8 KMs from new Delhi railway station ‚õΩ and the famous Connaught place New Delhi
R167,1 Year,Emaar Mgf Commonwealth Games Village 2020,We can enjoy a sort of Resort type of stay here. Akshardham in the back drop it gives a spiritual feeling.
R168,1 Year,Emaar Mgf Commonwealth Games Village 2021,"Possibly one of the best housing complexes in all of Delhi-NCR, CWG Village Apartments is amazing. The complex is one of the best managed in Delhi NCR with round-the-clock security and is very professionally managed. The flats are spacious and has great views of Akshardham temple and/or CWG Sports Complex. There are various sports and entertainment amenities and ample parking. Landscaping is beautiful and it feels like a hill-station in the rains. The only issue is that of public transport such as autos, cabs and buses at the site."
R169,1 Year,Emaar Mgf Commonwealth Games Village 2022,"Awesome place to stay for those who are on temporary duty in Delhi. Only pay 330 for a single room with sharing fridge, microwave, RO and common sitting area. This place is only available for central/state govt officials. Environment too clean to morning walk. Safety point is awesome. But food quality of mess is not so good. You order food online."
R170,>3 Years,Emaar Mgf Commonwealth Games Village 2023,"It's a good community away from all hustle and bustle of metro city and yet in the middle of the city. Except for few daily need provision stores inside the complex, don't know how residents manage their needs because there is no market in the walking distance. Built over river bed, time will tell how strong the foundation is and how it can sustain from more than heavy rain or flood."

R4876,2 Years,Haware Citi,"One of the bad construction work I had ever seen my life.even building column is not straight of almost 26 buildings out of 28. even illiterate person also can see from his open eyes. That's why I sold my property from there at bldg no.11, flat no.2604. It's just 1%better than the slum."
R4877,2 Years,Haware Citi,"Haware Citi, located in Kasarvadavali, Thane, is a well-planned residential complex that offers a blend of affordability and convenience. It features multiple mid-rise towers with compact 1 and 2 BHK apartments, making it a good choice for small families and working professionals. The township provides decent internal amenities such as lifts, power backup, and security, along with common outdoor facilities like a children's play area and a clubhouse. Connectivity is one of the key highlights‚ÄîKasarvadavali is well-connected to Ghodbunder Road, offering easy access to Thane station, Borivali, and the Eastern Express Highway. The area has seen rapid development in recent years with several schools, hospitals, and supermarkets in close proximity. However, residents occasionally report issues like water supply inconsistencies and limited parking spaces, especially in older phases. Despite these minor drawbacks, the overall environment is peaceful, with ample greenery and a growing community. For first-time homebuyers or investors seeking budget-friendly housing options in Thane, Haware Citi presents a reasonable opportunity. It is especially appealing for those who prioritize location and basic amenities over high-end luxury."
R4878,2 Years,Haware Citi,"Good and Affordable Residential Complex. The construction quality of the buildings is moderate considering the prices of flats in this complex. Mostly working class non maharashtrian/local and migrant residents choose to buy flats here coz of the low prices. Amenities in the complex are okay, water supply is not regular or 24x7 though the residents claim that municipal water is available it's tanker water + RO supplied to most of the buildings here in this area. Too much dust pollution in this area coz of heavy construction activities along with the new RMC plant coming up next to Haware City. Good affordable housing if ignoring the above negatives."
R4879,2 Years,Haware Citi,Please someone tell me regarding water supply in haware city?? Building no. 25 -Titanium tower and building no 24 :- platinum tower I'm purchasing my house in haware please post review regarding water supply in these 2 tower üôè please post review

R12516,3 Years,ATS Greens Village,"I recently had the wonderful opportunity to visit ATS Noida, and I must say, the experience left me thoroughly impressed. Situated in the vibrant sector 93, what truly amazed me was the exceptional connectivity this place offers, especially the swift travel time from Faridabad. The convenience of access is definitely a major plus point for anyone considering a residence in this area. From the moment I arrived, the professionalism and attention to detail were evident. The security staff at the entrance was courteous and thorough, ensuring a sense of safety and well-being from the very beginning. The modernistic design and layout of the location and flats are a testament to ATS Noida's commitment to creating a contemporary and comfortable living environment. What stood out to me was the meticulous approach to security. With individual security personnel stationed at both the entrance and within every block, residents can rest assured that their safety is a top priority. This level of security adds a significant layer of reassurance, making ATS Noida an ideal choice for families and individuals seeking a secure and tranquil living space. Beyond the security features, ATS Noida has curated a range of amenities that truly enhance the quality of life for its residents. The availability of an essentials shop and pharmacy right within the premises speaks volumes about the convenience that this community offers. The inclusion of a swimming pool and a beautifully maintained garden further adds to the charm and luxury of this residence, providing ample opportunities for relaxation and recreation. Plenty of parking space for residents is also available. One of the most intriguing aspects for me was the proximity to major corporate offices. With prominent names like PWC, PAYTM, and Shopper's Stop just a glance away from the towers, ATS Noida effortlessly bridges the gap between work and home. This aspect alone adds a layer of convenience that few residential spaces can boast of. During my visit, I had the chance to speak with a resident, and their positive feedback only reinforced my impression of ATS Noida. Their experiences mirrored the attributes I observed, solidifying the notion that this is truly a place where comfort, security, and convenience coalesce to create an exceptional living experience. In conclusion, based on my experience and the insights I gathered, I wholeheartedly recommend ATS Noida as a prime residential option"

R12525,3 Years,ATS Greens Village,"Like most associations in noida with prepaid electricity meters, they deduct m. M. C and then cut your grid electricity when the balance is negative which is prohibited by the u. P. Electricity supply code. Only default in grid electricity dues can result in stopping grid supply to any flat after 15 days written notice as per the law. But unless we approach noida authority for a show cause against the b. O. M they will not stop breaking the law. Very sad that until the management is dissolved and fresh elections are held illegal actions will be done through the a. O. A office on a daily basis."

R33005,3 Years,Dreams Nandini,"Negative Review-
Dreams Nandini B-303
Never take B-303 flat on rent if you don't want to lose your security deposit amount & peace of mind.

Owner name Mr. & Mrs. Vijesh Niljagi

Society is well maintained.
Surrounding area is useless. Area is outskirt from city therefore no governance of Police hence you will face local villagers problems like Rash driving, High price for small work, Annoying DJ sound, Staring Girls etc.
NOT SAFE AT ALL.

I guess Positive reviews are from Owners only as they have to sale their property & dont want to reduce the price of it.

Environment clearance certificate is not received yet therefore SBI is not providing loan for this property.
think before making decision."
R33006,1 Year,Dreams Nandini,"Problems with society:
Contention between builder and residents. Builder has not given objection clearance even after 5 years of possession. Problems:

R28146,3 Years,DDA Samridhi Apartment,"I have been a part of this society for over three years. The community is nice, with plenty of area for children to play, parking, and even walking and jogging. Although it is not the finest due to DDA, the construction quality is passable, and the property is almost thirteen years old. The sole issue facing this community is the prevalence of stray dogs, which pose a serious risk to both adults and children. Despite the fact that many individuals, including children, have been bitten thus far, nothing much has been done about it."
R28147,>3 Years,DDA Samridhi Apartment,"One of the good society in Dwarka sec 18.
Registered with RWA.
Secured and maintained as well.
Ample of parking space managed by Park+.
Connected by wide roads on two side of society one side is on Golf Link Road.
Huge park just next to the main gate.
And here is also wide free space inside the society campus.
And it also have ample space for festive events."
R28148,2 Years,DDA Samridhi Apartment,Nice and well maintained society of Dwarka. Have been to this society multiple times but never found issue for parking. Society is having ample free space for parking in basement and ground levels. They have maintained parks and clean drinking water near gate.
R28149,2 Years,DDA Samridhi Apartment,A beautiful gated society. Green area with lots of parking space. Good security. Clean an green. All the basic necessities and facilities available. As it‚Äôs DDA so the construction is quite old.
R28150,>3 Years,DDA Samridhi Apartment,"Very big space in society, with two separate committees to manage it. Flat condition is only ok, individual owners have to renovate their flats as per their needs, otherwise construction is a bit old and constructed in DDA style. Flats are spacious and some modifications are allowed. Enough car parking but not fixed, depends on wherever slot is available. 4 entry gates. Lot of entry points from all sides. Lots of greenery around the society and right on the golf link road of Dwarka. Close proximity to airport, main markets in Dwarka and metro station of sector 12 are nearby. Venkateshwar hospital and Sachdeva school are also close among various other popular schools."
R28151,>3 Years,DDA Samridhi Apartment,Poor built quality but yet spacious. Big open area to play but with lot of stray dogs will accompany you. No power back up but yes lifts and common area lights will work in case of power failure. Low maintenance fee of Rs 1000/month but yet around Rs. 750 worth of water bill every month. Society is a house of crores of new mosquitoes every day but yet it‚Äôs ok.
R28152,>3 Years,DDA Samridhi Apartment,Nice an quite place
R28153,1 Year,DDA Samridhi Apartment,"Society is okay , however RWA staff and other services as per the rent which is too expensive! Civil servicing its poor, they don't help if something needed. Society' gaurds are not aware of anything if you need help in emergency Case's. RWA people talk rudely."
R28154,3 Years,DDA Samridhi Apartment,very big and properly managed society of dwarka. its situated in sector 18b. rooms are big.
R28155,2 Years,DDA Samridhi Apartment,Good complex but maintenance is very much needed. Rest all good
R28156,2 Years,DDA Samridhi Apartment,"One of the best societies of Dwarka. Open spaces for kids to play. Small fountain area for special occasions like chatt or Holi. Lots of rides and play slides for little ones. Evening bhajans all across the car free walking area. Prompt actions by RWA to citizen requests. But there are a few cons as well: 1. Stray dogs being feeded at open places by few residents has caused a tremendous rise in cases of dog bites.; 2. Lots of mosquitoes; 3. Lifts don't work up to basement parking, you have to carry your stuff up to the ground floor to catch the elevator; 4. Random construction of balconies and renovation cause nuisance; 5. Some kids play football and cricket with no safety nets, which might be an issue for little ones or older citizens as balls might hit."
R28157,3 Years,DDA Samridhi Apartment,"Pros: huge flats. Good plan. Airy and sunlit.

Cons:more cons than pros, big sewer smell all the time , mosquitos in abundance, reduce quality of living. Poor cleanliness and poor maintenance of the society.people lack respect for fellow residents. They will do construction at any odd hours.
Basement parking smells like a gutter all the time and lifts work only intermittently.

Not worth investing in."
R28158,1 Year,DDA Samridhi Apartment,"Too big residential society, could have been good but due to it's vast size it's a ok ok kind of society. Lots of dog issues are there, multiple dog bite incidents keep happening. Rwa is weak and etc etc. More than 50-60 percent flats have seepage issue."
R28159,1 Year,DDA Samridhi Apartment,"Good spacious flats, ample parking space, broad peripheral roads in the society, but too many (as in a lot of) stray dogs inside, if you don't like stray dogs or are afraid of them then you should choose other societies to invest in, there are many more options in Dwarka with 0 presence of strays in those society."

R15397,2 Years,Shrachi Greenwood Sonata,"I recently had the opportunity to explore the Bengal Shrachi Greenwood Sonata Complex located on Biswa Bangla Sarani in New Town, and I am pleased to share my experience.

The complex is strategically situated on Biswa Bangla Sarani, offering easy access to key areas in New Town. Its proximity to essential amenities, shopping centers, and transportation hubs makes it a convenient choice for residents.

The design of Bengal Shrachi Greenwood Sonata is noteworthy. The architectural elements blend seamlessly with the surrounding environment. The complex exhibits a modern yet harmonious aesthetic, contributing to the overall appeal.

The complex boasts a range of amenities that enhance the quality of life for its residents. From well-maintained green spaces to recreational facilities, it appears that Bengal Shrachi has taken care to create a holistic living environment. I particularly appreciated the swimming pool.

Security is a top priority, and I was pleased to see the robust safety measures in place. The gated community, surveillance systems, and professional security staff contribute to a secure living environment.

One of the highlights of my visit was the sense of community within the complex. Whether it was interacting with neighbors or participating in community events, it seems like Bengal Shrachi Greenwood Sonata fosters a positive and inclusive atmosphere.

The overall maintenance and cleanliness of the complex are commendable. Common areas are well-kept, and the landscaping adds to the aesthetic appeal. It's evident that the management invests in maintaining a high standard of cleanliness and order.

In conclusion, my experience at Bengal Shrachi Greenwood Sonata Complex was overwhelmingly positive. The combination of a strategic location, impressive design, comprehensive amenities, and a strong sense of community makes it a desirable place to live."

R111505,2 Years,The Prestige City,Fraudulent promises! They said that the hill view from bellanza would never be blocked as no buildings would come in front of it. They may build some bungalows maybe and now they have launched 66 storey buildings of the forest hill project right in front of bellanza. Complete fraud sale! Untrustworthy!
R111505,1 Year,The Prestige City,"There are water issues started in nearby areas..so think before buying...how water requirements will be fulfilled...bmc does not have capacity to provide drinking water for existing societies...not sure how they will fulfill need of such Huge projects...in long term they also need to depend on tankers which will eventually increase maintenance...builder will provide support in the initial years but in long term societies will face problems...as recently 14apr2025, due to water tanker strike, the kanakia rainforest society people on hillside had no water for days even by paying 2-3 cr in Andheri East...so you can think of what will be situation here..."

R111505,2 Years,The Prestige City,"Such a sham!! Prestige, as we knew it from our earlier association ( since 2015) having invested in 2 of its projects in Bangalore, has truly let us down.
While booking a home at Prestige city Mulund we were assured of a forever open view of the hills. On being asked categorically the sales person assured that the future development that would come before the Bellenza tower would be row houses , if at all.
But now they have launched a new 66 stories tower right opposite Bellenza, selling it as a premium project with an uninterrupted view of the Yogi hills the same promise that was earlier made to the unsuspecting Bellenza buyers.
Such a fraudulent company Prestige has turned out to be putting all its credibility at stake. You have lost our trust Prestige. BEWARE all prospective buyers who are looking to invest in Prestige smart city.
Really pathetic.Never buying from you Prestige."
R111505,3 Years,The Prestige City,"Fraudulent People and A Cheat Company.
While selling Bellenza, they said there will be small row houses in front and now tower even bigger than Bellanza planned in front to block the open area and view. The new 66 floor tower planned named Forest hill just right in front of that Bellanza. I must say, Prestige sales team are fraud and do not shy away from lying. I feel I am cheated post purchase now."
R111505,>3 Years,The Prestige City,This project is on Leasehold land and the prices quoted are over and above those on freehold ones! Buyers beware!!
R111505,>3 Years,The Prestige City,"This is touted as a great project backed by reputation of Prestige which is a big deal in Bangalore. I thought they would be different from other builders and took their assurance of unrestricted Mountain view at face value. When asked about land marked as ‚Äúfor future development‚Äù the sales person speaking on behalf of Prestige assured that all FSI was consumed and only a bungalow project will come up there. This assurance was further corroborated by the Sales head.

2 years later ‚Ä¶ lo behold ‚Ä¶ a spanking 60+ storey project ‚Äú Forest Hill‚Äù is planned bang opposite Bellenza so for me it is Bye Bye Mountain View and Prestige's reputation.

When I recently went to their office I was very sweetly given some cock and bull story of the mysterious emergence of FSI and cherry on the cake was that the salesperson who assured verdant Mountain view has left the firm. I was also given the option of booking a flat in the upcoming project ‚Ä¶. Cheeky isn‚Äôt it ? üòÇüòÇüòÇ

The option that ‚Äútrusting idiots‚Äù like me have is to do nothing, post on social in the hope that others won‚Äôt blindly trust such Assurances but I know it won‚Äôt work ‚Ä¶.. if anyone can think of a 3rd option let me know.

One thing I can vouch for is that Prestige may make ‚Äúdon‚Äôt intend to keep‚Äù assurances to sell flats but in return they Will periodically send a fancy magazine about luxury products ‚Ä¶. Guess that should be compensation enough üòú"

Now after 2.6 years later we are shocked to know that new project Forest Hills is gone launch which is 66 storyed tower right in front of our wing we have paid huge amount of floor rise just to see forest view. We and our lot of friend who have booked in Bellenza for such mesmerizing view is now shattered. This is a scam, cheating with us we trusted you, your name, legacy all is now a question mark we had lot of faith and trust on Prestige Group and Mr. Irfan Razak which is now completely destroyed.

Still there are so many heavy vehicles parked on the road and I hope u don‚Äôt expect us to pass through it. They need to be relocated on a better and broader road which is just adjacent to our road.

It‚Äôs a 2 way thin road and the only entry to enter yogi hills and just for that 200m road we have to wait for 20-30 minutes because of the tracreated by these people. There is no one to manage the traffic no one to help ppl.

R869036,1 Year,Gem Nakshathra¬†,"Purchasing a flat here now feels like a decision that didn‚Äôt fully meet our expectations. We bought the flat in January 2022, but the project progressed at a very slow pace. After numerous follow-ups and requests, we finally received the handover, though only with basic amenities in place.

It‚Äôs been nearly a year, and there are still challenges with the Gem management, particularly in how they handle resident queries. There‚Äôs hope that things might improve in 2-3 years, especially after Towers B and C are handed over to their respective owners.

That said, given the price we paid, it‚Äôs unlikely we could have found a similar option in this location. Hence, Overall I‚Äôd rate it 3 stars. "

2.As per RERA completion date is 2026 August for B , C towers .

3. Quality wise good but work progress is slow. Not Mivan construction its a block work.

4. After lot of research I booked in 2021 and management committed to handover in 2024  .. but it's going to handover In 2026.

5.very near to upcoming IT area neopolis and GAR projects , prestige IT tower , high rise residentials etc..

6.project front side 100 feet road connectivity from neopolis yet to develop .

4.walkble distance from upcoming 400 feet hare krishna  temple ( completion by 2028 ).

Proper community  Maintainence not up to the mark and hopefully it will be stable .

Updated 2023 - management is least bothered about old flat buyers and don‚Äôt engage them actively.
Very poor transparency -about communicating delays in project ,they need introspect this else will be lost lose situation.

2019-
I am one the first buyer of flat  here in 2019,  the customer experience has been very good and their main office( GEM VIVENDAS) is at kondapur,
This place is good for investment and sales team at the site are also very patient and reachable.

The company is experienced builder and this is a focussed and big project for them and they will have to beat tough competition with big projects near to it.

Yes, there have been delays due to covid like every project and it is picked up later and this could be one of good community in future.
With right price it could be very good investment specially in kokapet.

My review shall be edited in the next few years as per the construction progress."

We booked flat 3 years back. While booking, they committed to complete by April 2022..but due to Covid, they extended project to Dec'22.

Please complete project ASAP"
R869036,>3 Years,Gem Nakshathra¬†,"Update as of 18 Aug 2023:

Delayed again. They are unable to install and operate one Service lift since past 8 months. Management has no clue on the delay and communication is absolutely zero. Very very pathetic and sluggish attitude.

Update as of 22 Feb 2023:

Disappointed!!
Project seems to have a significant delay despite getting extended by 1 year due to covid. They are now committing to start registrations(floor by floor) in Tower A from April 2023 which still seems to be an aggressive timeline based on the pending works.  Communication on regular updates is also very scarce. Apart from the so called quarterly news letters there's nothing solid to gain investors confidence.

####

After a lot of thought & research, we landed on GEM Nakshatra and we don't regret it one bit. Project is going on at a decent pace. Last I heard, they are planning to start other tower construction (adjacent to the ongoing one) very soon.

Location:

A wide 120ft road is approved in the front. This area is one of the happening places in Hyderabad currently. There are a lot of high rise buildings coming up not far from this project, both commercial and residential like Rajapushpa West Avenue, Prestige Tranquil, The crown by SAS etc.

Builder & Experience:

Builder has been around in the construction field for quite some time and has executed few projects successfully. Our experience with them is quite smooth and happy so far. Staff are super courteous,  extends greetings with a warm smile and addresses all our queries happily.

Price has also been relatively reasonable."
R869036,>3 Years,Gem Nakshathra¬†,"A highly professional real estate company, Gem Nakshathra, went above and beyond to find the right property for my needs.

Working with them is a comfortable experience, and I recommend them to others."
R869036,>3 Years,Gem Nakshathra¬†,"Very slow project. Very much disappointed.
They promised to complete by April 2022, but Silently they changed completion date in RERA to April 2023 and even could not complete by April 2023. Very slow project  and management does not concern about their promise. They Lost customer trust."
R869036,>3 Years,Gem Nakshathra¬†,"Until now, I've bought three properties from Gem Group. Their entire home buying experience has been so enjoyable. I was fully informed about the property I was purchasing, and they answered all the questions I asked. As of now, I am really pleased with the property's after-sales maintenance. They are always on hand in case of any problems. I would most likely buy another property from them in the future."
R869036,>3 Years,Gem Nakshathra¬†,"Project got delayed & response from gem management about delay is not transparent. Looks like the man power is less  in the construction site. Dec 2022 was promised after covid, now it seems by May they will allow for interiors work.
All other projects are progressing faster with respect to delivery in kokapet.

Disappointed with management overall.

If you are a owner of a flat, ping me to get urself added in our watsapp grp."
R869036,>3 Years,Gem Nakshathra¬†,"Thoroughly unprofessional and arrogant sales folks.

- you ask them availability they show you only just 1-2 units and others are sold out , and in between when you make a choice they say your choice is sold out. They then give you a choice of another unit which was never there as available at the beginning of discussion.PATHETIC!!
A mere glance into RERA is enough to give you an idea of inventory.

- They dont share legal docs if i want to process my loan with banks not associated with them, but they will keep you in LIMBO WASTING YOUR TIME( vasavi / rajapushpa / vertex etc are more than happy to assist you here and flexible with customer needs)

I saved myself from a lifelong regret being with GEM Nakhatra.

Wish there was a 0 star rating."
R869036,>3 Years,Gem Nakshathra¬†,"The project was delayed, and the response from Gem Nakshathra, Kokapet - Gem Group management was vague. There appear to be less workers on the job site. After pledging a December 2022 completion date, it looks that interior development will be allowed through at least August 2023. All other developments in Kokatapet are proceeding faster in terms of completion. Overall, I am unhappy with management."
R869036,>3 Years,Gem Nakshathra¬†,Before buying check the quality of the construction and go through the agreement and take a written request with the builder. We suffered a lot with this builder and no revert from him for his promises and car parking slot not allotted till date

R369868,>3 Years,Shapoorji Joyville Hadapsar Annexe,"The society is severely lacking very basic amenities of power and water. The power outage issue is very rampant in the society and the water supply also gets affected intermittently. The issue of mosquitoes is also very much here and you will find swarms of mosquitoes entering your flat even when windows are kept open only for 10-15 mins and that too at higher floors like 18th and 20th floor. Security system at the society is also not very robust and you may find your shoes and other belongings getting misplaced now and then if kept outside your flat. Not to mention that the society is bit secluded from the main road and local market and you may have to commute atleast 1-2 kms to find proper market and shops.
The amenities are good but the lack of basic necessities overshadows everything. Overall you find a rosy picture of the society from outside but there are serious basic issues hovering within the society."
R369868,>3 Years,Shapoorji Joyville Hadapsar Annexe,"I am extremely disappointed with the facilities at Joyville Hadapsar. There are frequent water issues and power cuts, which make it very difficult to live here, especially for those working remotely. If you are doing a work-from-home or remote job, this place is not suitable at all. Power goes out anytime, and water supply is also unreliable. These basic amenities should be well-maintained in a residential society, but unfortunately, that‚Äôs not the case here."
R369868,>3 Years,Shapoorji Joyville Hadapsar Annexe,"Joyville Annexe by Shapoorji Pallonji in Hadapsar is an excellent blend of modern living and natural surroundings. The project offers spacious and well-ventilated apartments with thoughtfully designed layouts. Amenities like clubhouse, swimming pool, gym, landscaped gardens, and children‚Äôs play areas cater to all age groups. The location is a major plus ‚Äì close to IT parks like Magarpatta and SP Infocity, schools, hospitals, and shopping centers, ensuring convenience at your doorstep. The overall vibe is serene and community-friendly, making it ideal for families and professionals alike.
"
R369868,>3 Years,Shapoorji Joyville Hadapsar Annexe,"I've been staying here as a resident for the last 4 months . Sharing my experience during this time.

The 1st impression of this society is wonderful. You'll feel it is well planned. The amenities offered are also amazing and nicely maintained. Spacious ground, big pool, club house, etc gives nice premium feel.

But that's it. When it comes to basic necessities, this society fails to fulfill.
Power outages happen very frequently. We've been observing outages as frequently as 3-5 times a week.  Sometimes more than that. I enquired in surrounding areas about outages, but found out that houses/shops in shevalwadi area don't face power outages frequently, it's just the joyville.
Due to frequent power outages elevator functioning also gets affected. Already there's just 2 elevators for a 22 floor flat where there's 6 flats on each floor. Most of the time we see one of the 2 lift is under maintenance mode.
Not just power, but here we have issues with water as well. They provide Well water and that too many times gets over and we had to wait for hours for them to release.

If you're planning to invest here , do consider discussing the issues with the builder and also the residents."
R369868,>3 Years,Shapoorji Joyville Hadapsar Annexe,"Good Society, has vast range of amenities.."
R369868,>3 Years,Shapoorji Joyville Hadapsar Annexe,"Excellent society developed by shapoorji palonji , with proximity to all new facilities such as Upcoming Metro station , Kharadi and Magarpatta IT park and proposed Pune Airport"
R369868,>3 Years,Shapoorji Joyville Hadapsar Annexe,"A very well-planned residential project with great amenities and a peaceful environment. The society has well-maintained gardens, a clubhouse, a swimming pool, lawn tennis court, and other modern facilities that make it a comfortable place to live. The apartments are spacious with good ventilation.

The location is also great as its nearby magarpatta.

Overall, it‚Äôs a great option for those looking for a well-equipped, modern living space in Hadapsar, especially for families."
R369868,>3 Years,Shapoorji Joyville Hadapsar Annexe,"I recently visited Joyville and was highly impressed with the overall project. The community is well-planned, offering modern amenities, spacious layouts, and a great living environment. The construction quality appears top-notch, and the surroundings are clean and well-maintained. The clubhouse, green spaces, and security features add to the appeal."

R395174,>3 Years,Promax Dreamville Home,"I recently purchased my dream home! From the moment I stepped through the door, I knew I had found something special. The layout is spacious and well-designed, perfect for both relaxing evenings and entertaining guests. The natural light that fills the space adds to the welcoming atmosphere, making every room feel bright and inviting. The bedrooms are cozy retreats, offering a peaceful oasis to unwind after a long day. Highly recommend to anyone in search of their perfect home sweet home!

Points noted, why I choose this flat:

I was captivated by the harmonious flow of energy, which I believe is due to its impeccable Vastu compliance.

The amenities provided are nothing short of impressive. The kids' play area is a delight, offering a safe and engaging space for little ones to frolic and explore, and the kids' library adds an educational and imaginative dimension to their playtime.

For fitness enthusiasts, the well-equipped gym is a dream come true, providing state-of-the-art facilities to help residents stay healthy and active. The open theatre is a fantastic addition, offering the perfect setting for outdoor movie nights under the stars.

And when it's time to celebrate, the party hall provides a spacious and elegant venue for gatherings and special occasions, ensuring memorable moments with friends and family.

As for the builder, their dedication to excellence is evident in every aspect of the home. From the sturdy construction to the high-quality materials used throughout, it's clear that they take pride in their work.

Furthermore, the property's bank approval and RERA approval provide an additional layer of assurance, ensuring that the investment is not only secure but also compliant with regulatory standards.

Overall, I'm very happy with my decision to purchase a home from this builder. They have created a beautiful, well-crafted home that I will enjoy for years to come. Thank you for providing such a wonderful living experience!

R395174,>3 Years,Promax Dreamville Home,"Our experience with Promax Property Builders was above and beyond our expectations. Their DreamVille Home project is an excellent and well-planned apartment. They have made everything so easy. DreamVille Home is a beautiful place to setup your own abode and in a great location close to everything. It is one the best property if you are looking for a 3 bhk. Located in a prime location with all amenities. Kanthraj, the proprietor is very humble and approachable. I can‚Äôt express how stress free and easy the process was to select our features and build our home. Everything went on so smooth and we knew that we had made a right choice by choosing Promax property's DreamVille Home apartment.
Kanthraj and team have been really flexible and helpful from day one of our interaction and have been very open and transparent. Their team was always just a call away whenever we needed help."

The project is located in a pleasant and convenient area.
Very well planned and designed. Each flat having their own private area and no common walls between the flats.
Very ethical and responsible builder. Quality of construction is excellent. Flooring and fittings are customised with a very less flat cost compare to other near by projects. Iam happy to recommend the project to my friends and colleagues."
R395174,>3 Years,Promax Dreamville Home,Nice project located in an excellent location. We like the floor plans and elevation design. Floor plans are as per vastu. Iam happy that i have purchased a flat in Dreamville home.
R319475,>3 Years,Adani Atelier Greens,"I had a wonderful experience during my visit to Adani Atelier Greens, thanks to the exceptional support provided by Suresh Choudhary. He was incredibly helpful, guiding us through every step with patience and clarity. Each time we visited, he took the time to show us around thoroughly, always ensuring we felt comfortable and well-informed. Suresh listened attentively, showed genuine compassion, and responded to all our questions with respect and understanding. His professionalism and warmth truly made the entire process much easier and more reassuring for us. I am glad to be part of Adani and super excited to see the final look of the place in July."
R319475,>3 Years,Adani Atelier Greens,"Visited personally the Atelier Greens project by Adani Reality few days back to book a 2.5 bhk flat there. Very nice and central location in heart of city. Although few earlier reviews complained of delay in completion of project but presently work is going on at fast speed and possession of all flats is likely to be given by this year end.
I specifically want to mention about Asstt. Sales Manager Mr. Rajesh Mane who showed us the project and explained everything. He answered all our queries very patiently. He is accessible at any time to answer any doubts and very helpful in coordinating all the formalities. He is really a good asset to the company. Thanks a lot Rajesh for everything.
I liked the project layout and amenities and hope finished product delivered will be true to specification given to us. I also hope that no high rise buildings come in future at adjoining vacant plots so that good view, sunlight and fresh air is available in future also.
As of now it's highly recommended to book flat here by anyone who wants their dream house to be in central location with all luxurious amenities."
R319475,>3 Years,Adani Atelier Greens,"Lots of false promises by the sales team while selling the flat, as promised by other reviews below too. It is already running delayed and the CSMs continue giving robotic replies whenever any concern is raised or reminded of the false promises. However, they're excellent at sugarcoated lip-service."
R319475,>3 Years,Adani Atelier Greens,Good project. Area utilisation is good. Rajesh Mane explained the project details very well and helped with queries promptly.
R319475,>3 Years,Adani Atelier Greens,"We have identified serious concerns regarding the project, and Adani‚Äôs response has only commented the design approval by their so-called world-class design team

Me: The height of the sliding window frame situated in the kitchen that provides access to the balcony is insufficient and poses a significant safety hazard. This issue is particularly concerning because the inadequate height significantly increases the risk of accidents, such as the top of the frame hitting the head or tripping or falling, for anyone using this window frame, especially anyone at or above the height of 6 feet. Given the seriousness of the potential consequences, it is imperative that this issue be addressed and rectified without delay. Ensuring the safety and well-being of all occupants should be a top priority, and we strongly urge you to take immediate corrective action to bring the window frame to the appropriate height standards.
Adani reply : The Project team has completed the work in accordance with the approved design and drawings approved by the Architect / Design team. Therefore, we are unable to adjust the height of the sliding door.

Me : The utility area adjacent to the common bathroom has been left completely exposed, lacking a proper window or enclosure. This is unacceptable, as it leaves the space to dust, insects, and severe privacy violations. We demand immediate action to enclose this area and rectify the oversight without delay.
Adani reply : The Project team has completed the work according to the approved design and drawings finalized by the Architect & Design team.

Me : We would like to get some understanding on how the maintenance will be calculated once we get possession of the flat, as we understand that we will not be able to access some of the amenities until phase 2 comes to completion. Additionally, could you shed some light on the status of building D? Is this going to be allocated to MHADA, and if not, what are the plans for it? We were informed that the actual MHADA building will be located at another site.
Realistically, by when can we expect the actual possession of the flat to occupy, and has the OC (Occupancy Certificate) application been submitted?
Full OC date??
Adani Reply : 1) Maintenance will be calculated starting from the Offer of Possession and will only apply to amenities that are ready for use.
2) The LIG Tower Relocation Plan was underway & we are still waiting for the final approval.
3) Possession is expected once we receive the OC. Please note that all compliance related to the OC application is anticipated to be completed by the end of March 25.

Below mention concerns which adani is opting not to comment on

1. Fall ceiling with lights in all rooms, especially something to cover the fire prevention pipes.
2. Smart Lock for the main door of the flat & lifts, with smart access cards.
3. Garbage shoots for waste disposal.
4. Planters and a vertical garden in the balconies, with a gardener visiting every fortnight for plant maintenance.
5. Gas Line in the kitchen.

Also, there is absolute no clarity on the actual readiness of the entire project, including all 07 towers."
R319475,>3 Years,Adani Atelier Greens,"Totally disappointed by the product that will be delivered. We were completely mislead by them and feel completely frustrated now to have trusted on the brand name and the promises made by their sales team.
We understand that operational delays are part and parcel of construction companies, however even after taking so much time, not delivering all promises made by this builder is completely disappointing.
Having invested all our savings into what we would call our home(hopefully), we‚Äôre not getting what we paid for.

Here are some examples
The frame of the kitchen balcony is hardly around 6ft, so anyone at or over that height has to remember to duck before passing through..
Also the access window to the utility room next to the bathroom is exposed to external elements and without any closable window.
Like pointed out by some other folks here, no digital lock, no planters or vertical garden in the balconies. The sales team also bragged about a gardener visiting to care for the plants every 15 days but nope that won‚Äôt be happening. They have just given a provision of having planters and nothing else..
No garbage shoot as promised
No Gas line provision as promised
No false ceiling in any of the rooms.
No lights as promised

We don‚Äôt mind paying at all our milestones in time however I‚Äôm sorry to say but it is really unfair to continue to meet the deadlines for some substandard product delivered by them.

My 2cents - Do your research and please DO NOT give in to their false and bloated sales pitch.

I believe that if you cannot deliver, then don‚Äôt promise.."
R319475,>3 Years,Adani Atelier Greens,Great facade and quality construction. Rajesh from sales team was excellent with timely responses
R319475,>3 Years,Adani Atelier Greens,Food was amazing worthy good service so totally 5star
R319475,>3 Years,Adani Atelier Greens,Highly misleading project. They are not delivering the building as shown by them in pictures and videos. The luxury touch given by glass facade in C tower (front tower) is missing. It makes the building look terrible especially right next to poonawalla fincorp. The buyers should protest and fight for their rights. Even after the delay they can't deliver the building as shown by them. People should not buy here. Never believe the promised date of possession because the project is already delayed by 2 years.
R319475,>3 Years,Adani Atelier Greens,"Decent size 2-2.5-3BHK
between 1.78-1.98cr.
location advantage
2towers possession given
2more end 2025
basics light fan tap NO add-on
only hassle is multilevel parking
although the dedicated parking slot will still remain with the valet."
R319475,>3 Years,Adani Atelier Greens,"The images and videos shown of the ready building depicting a rich glass facade in the front tower is not going to be present in the actual building. They are saying that it's purely pictorial presentation only to make our product look good. Secondly, kind of disappointed by the possession issues which are delayed by one year now. People who are being told that the possession is going to be handed over by September 25, consider a minimum of September 26. Also the fact that they aren't providing things like digital door lock which was promised by the sales team. The fire fighting system installed in the apartments won't be covered by false ceiling which makes the flats look ugly."
R319475,>3 Years,Adani Atelier Greens,"Attractive flat system, luxury flats"
R319475,>3 Years,Adani Atelier Greens,"#bestforthelast
Heard they have announced the launch of their last tower THE CYPRESS - do check it out, East West facing homes, vastu compliant and almost nearing possession. One of the only gated community in that stretch of street with great views of the mula mutha river and its surroundings."
R319475,>3 Years,Adani Atelier Greens,"I visited the construction site of this apartment building and was blown away by the professionalism and warmth of the sales team. Despite the ongoing construction, they took the time to give me a comprehensive tour, answering all my questions with patience.

Although the building is still in progress, it's evident that meticulous attention to detail is being paid to every aspect of its design and construction. The USP of the project being larger carpet areas then many of the newly constructed projects and early possesion. From the prime location presence, I can already envision what a wonderful living space this will be once completed.

What truly sets this experience apart, however, is the exceptional service provided by the sales team. Mr. Rajesh Mane and other important sales team members and managers were always present to help explain any doubts and process. Kudos to the sales team for their outstanding efforts in representing this future gem of an apartment building!"
R319475,>3 Years,Adani Atelier Greens,"The best carpet area we ever saw was in this project, the quickest possesion was here, the location is also quite good with equal distance to airport n stn.
The drawbacks is they are giving only 1 parking space that too shared on a carlift for a 2 bhk, and this info was shared only at the time of signing up the form.even requesting for a second paid parking was denied rightaway.
Now, the main issue., the CRM person is the most rudest ,arrogant and pathetic.Although it's called Customer Relationship but the CRM doesn't have the faintiest idea of what customer service is.The team here acts as if they are the GODS and whatever they say and do is the ultimate word.they seems to have no supervision and whoever they report is in Mumbai so they get their say as the final. Also their actions go unchecked and without any repercussions.
A simple request for a annexure details and fldraft copy of the agreement was vehemently denied even after paying the token amount of 5%.
They demanded that the stamp duty charges to be paid and only after that they would share the draft copy, even though Rera website has all the details already published . See their arm twisting tactics!!!
Also, my form was mysteriously edited by some unknown person and no-one claimed responsibility for it. And NO ACTION Was taken. BY THE MANAGEMENT.
Even after paying the stampduty as demanded I still had to wait a week to get the required document since the Person's laptop was broken.is this how a professional orgnisation works? Isn't there a concept of team ??imagine a CRM shouting at the customer from her office!!! That's the level of customer relationship they have.the CRM doesn't even want to hear what I have to say even after sharing the previous documents ,such arrogance!!! I cannot go into he details of everything given the public domain this is.Like I said they are the GODS and no one is to supervise or question them?!!!!! So be prepared to face all such prejudices if you ever want to invest and buy from builders team."

R319475,1 Year,Adani Atelier Greens,Visited for enquiry. Mr Utkarsh took us through the property and we had a fabulous experience with him. He took us to multiple options that we wanted to look at and detailed out the plans. A truly luxe experience. A very positive feedback for Mr Utkarsh. Price is on higher side.
R319475,2 Years,Adani Atelier Greens,"not worth money ,let them finish the project and then you decide its worth buying at that huge price."
R319475,2 Years,Adani Atelier Greens,"Worst Builder..Beware don't Purchase Anything in this Project.
We had bought a apartment in this project and there has been no progress in work for about 3 years now. And the builder is a cheapster he doesn't even have a penny to start work only looting clients and stealing their money."
R329835,2 Years,SCC Blossom,"Very cheap builder and sales team who are taking money in the name of holding the flat prior to booking And after cancellation on the same day not returning the amount even after 5 months of strong follow-ups through calls to multiple person and personal visits. We have paid rs 21000 to hold the flat while we confirm the unit if that suites to us as the unit was sold out which we went to visit ...still on their request we paid the amount to hold the unit for single day and that guy Mr Rahul Made papers like we already booked the flat and after that ignored us while we visited him to meet to get our Refund.

Pathetic team ... Each person is just wasting time and money of customers ...and just playing football by asking the customer to go here and there .

Advise to all ...dont invest ur precious money in such builders. God grace we haven't invested money in lakhs otherwise that would also become bad debts for us."

Not complete
Good location üëå"
R329835,1 Year,SCC Blossom,All are thiefs in sales office sitting over there. Even the builder is. Please be aware of the unilateral sale agreement they serve to you post obtaining 5-6 lacs of your hard earned money. Please be careful reading all terms in agreement they serve. All n every term indicates about high penalties being charged from you. Not even a single line where they promises of actual date of handling over of occupancy certificate. Without obtaining occupancy certificate every single authority consider said possession as illegal. Baad main court k chakkar lagane se badhiya hai.. agreement main shuru main thoda dhyaan dein. Take little legal advice if you are not able to understand agreement. But without having clear knowledge on it request each to not enter into it. Aise terms hain court bhi ni bacha paegi...üòî
R329835,0.5 Year,SCC Blossom,Construction goes in full swing . Good location easy transportation
R329835,3 Years,SCC Blossom,"It is said that truth does not need proof, dear brothers and sisters, please take a look at the previous two projects and be proud of their condition before falling here. Tell me their smooth formula and I will come to your senses. There is a lot of 3rd class society and builder. This place is a blot on the name of society, all the useless persons have been kept in it but its builder is of no use. I am presenting some pictures to confirm my statement. Public is also not less here, so long as they do whatever they want. No rules/regulations and discipline are visible from door to door."
R329835,2 Years,SCC Blossom,"Please please never buy or rent in any SCC flats, either be it sapphire, heights or blossom.
